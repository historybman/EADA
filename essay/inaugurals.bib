	abstract = {This article reports a content analysis of the 49 inaugural addresses of the presidents of the United States. In it, two basic issues are addressed--whether or not there is a civil religious dimension present in the inaugural addresses, and, if present, what are its characteristics. The findings were as follows: In all inaugural addresses the presence of a civil religious dimension was detected. Its content, as was suggested by Bellah (1970) and Cherry (1970), focuses around the themes of Exodus, Sacrifice, Destiny under God, and International Example. The prevalence of each was dependent upon the historical situation. A theoretical framework is built that suggests the presence and characteristics of civil religion perform three functions of culture building, culture affirmation, and, most importantly, legitimation.},

	abstract = {Intercorrelations among stylistic and emotional variables and construct validity deduced from relationships to other ratings of U.S. presidents suggest that power language (language that is linguistically simple, emotionally evocative, highly imaged, and rich in references to American values) is an important descriptor of inaugural addresses. Attempts to predict the use of power language in inaugural addresses from variables representing the times (year, media, economic factors) and the man (presidential personality) lead to the conclusion that time-based factors are the best predictors of the use of such language (81\% prediction of variance in the criterion) while presidential personality adds at most a small amount of prediction to the model. Changes in power language are discussed as the outcome of a tendency to opt for breadth of communication over depth.},
