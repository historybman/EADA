Abstract: "This collection of documents with commentary explores the meaning of absolute monarchy by examining how Louis XIV of France became one of Europe's most famous and successful rulers. In the introduction, William Beik integrates the theoretical and practical nature of absolutism and its implications for the development of European states and society. The documents, newly translated and carefully selected for their readability, examine the problems of the Fronde, Colbert's grasp of the economic and fiscal dimensions of the kingdom, the taming of the rural nobility, the interaction of royal ministers and provincial authorities, the repression of Jansenists and Protestants, popular rebellions, and royal image making."--Jacket.

Sentimentality: Island Caribs in the European Literary Imagination, 1660s-1760s.
Abstract: When the natives of Hispaniola first told Christopher Columbus of their feared enemies to the east - using the Arawak word caniba or carib - the admiral considered two possible explanations. Either these fierce warriors were soldiers of the nearby Great Khan (Spanish can) or they were cannibals. Europeans' dawning awareness of New World geography soon proved Columbus's first theory wrong. But the second has persisted for centuries. In Cannibal Encounters Philip Boucher analyzes the images - and the realities - of European relations with the people known as Island Caribs during the first three centuries after Columbus. Boucher begins by examining the current debate about the Caribs' ethnic origins and the controversy over their supposed cannibalism. Subsequent chapters show how French and English Caribbean policies evolved and how those policies were related to - and influenced by - literary and cultural images in the work of such thinkers as Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. Although the French and the English developed similar plantation economies that meant harsh treatment for the Caribs, French relations with the islanders were usually less strained than those of the British. Among the reasons for this difference, Boucher argues, were the benevolent influence of French missionaries and merchants and the firm hand of French government, which restrained colonialists' worst excesses. Based on literary sources, travelers' observations, and missionary accounts, as well as on French and English colonial archives and administrative correspondence, Cannibal Encounters offers a vivid portrait of a troubled chapter in the history of European-Amerindian relations.

	abstract = {This dissertation examines the social construction of space and identity in the Great Lakes, and interior west of North America. The primary focus of study is the interaction between Native and European peoples. This is a study about empire and colonization in the Great Lakes and interior west of North America. It is also an attempt to place Native peoples at the center of a narrative about the historical development of the continent. This dissertation argues that the western interior remained indigenous and autonomous until the late 19 th century, in spite of European and Euro-American claims of possession and sovereignty. It further contends that the Native peoples who migrated between the indigenous west and the colonial east significantly influenced the process of colonization in Canada and the Great Lakes, and significantly impacted the development of social structures and categories in the larger Atlantic World. In this story Native peoples do not lose themselves in a New World that is not of their own making. Rather, they are at the heart of a continental process of transformation that determined meaning race, nation, and citizenship in modern North America.},

The parish of Belm near the town of Osnabr√ºck in Northwest Germany is marked by a strong inequality between a minority of peasants with large land holdings and the majority of landless peasants, who were labourers, tenants and linen producers at the same time. This article seeks to analyze the relations between the individual families of the two classes in detail by examining economic ties like land-lease, labour and credit, as well as social ties like kinship and godparenthood. Both mobility and stability can be assessed: the micro-historical approach helps to better understand both the coherence and the tensions in local society.},

Yet documentary records indicate that many Europeans recognized American Indian territoriality and the power‚Äîsovereignty‚Äîaccrued by their control of bordered political space. Europeans had to negotiate, and were subject to, the rules and controls of Indian jurisdiction. In the heart of Spanish borderlands we can begin to conceptualize borders as defined by Indian peoples and nations, be they hunter-gatherers, sedentary agriculturalists, or nomadic raiders. Studying the ways that each created and maintained borders according to economy, trade, raiding, hunting, kinship, enmity, and alliance makes clear how Indian polities exercised power with unequivocal spatial dimensions across the landscapes of early America.},

To Continental army colonel, member of the American Philosophical Society, and gentleman farmer George Morgan, it was the Hessian fly, an invader as odious as the Hessians, introduced from the Old World. Entomologists at the time had trouble identifying the origins of the fly. Joseph Banks, a British scientific adviser, fearing that wheat imported from the United States could introduce the pest into Great Britain, helped shape the British ban on importing American wheat, a policy proposed by hard-liners to punish the rebellious Americans. Crop failure in Great Britain and the resulting prospect of starvation and revolution reversed the ban, as the hypothetical biological risks seemed less dangerous than the political risks of the period. The Hessian fly probably was carried in forage the British transported to the colonies during the American Revolution.

His design revolved around several specific points: Spain could not financially shoulder the burden of transporting loyal, Catholic immigrants from Europe; Protestant Americans were near at hand, and with the institution of parishes and priests to administer to and educate them, they would soon become loyal subjects; the colonization effort must not fall into the hands of land-hungry entrepreneurs who would promise their clients self-government and freedom of religion, thereby creating inside the province a threat already present outside of it. Indeed, it was against this threat that the idea of a buffer province had originally been conceived. Intrigues of the power-seeking Frenchman Pierre Wouves d'Arg√®s, of the American adventurer and western separatist James K. Wilkinson, and of the entrepreneur Colonel George Morgan could not deflect Mir√≥ from his plan. Although his proposals were often adopted and transmitted to the crown by others, the inspiration was Mir√≥'s. The Governor retired in 1792 and his policy gave way under the pressures of Spain's other commitments, as well as the resulting upheavals of the French Revolution.},

Rioting and skirmishes with British authorities were frequent and, in 1769, an attempt to impress fishermen into the British navy resulted in the death of a British officer.

Apprenticed to a ship's captain, Bowen returned as a young man to Marblehead to manufacture rigging. Ruined by the decline in shipping during the American Revolution, he returned to sailing briefly in middle age, then lived the end of his life in penury, subsisting on odd jobs. Other findings based on Bowen's diary: sailors engaged in numerous other trades associated with sailing, disease and war continually interrupted sailor's fortunes, and the sailor's life, though far-flung at times, generally centered on one locality.},

	abstract = {This essay examines the nature of family and friendship among commercial fishermen in colonial Massachusetts during the two decades leading up to the American Revolution. Historians tend to overemphasize the extent to which maritime labor separated men from their homes and communities. Merchant mariners on long hauls, whalers, cod fishermen and even naval seamen, we are told, lived separate lives than those on shore. But did all mariners everywhere experience the same degree of isolation? Colonial fishermen who worked in the eighteenth-century Massachusetts cod fisheries did not. Skippers were more isolated than sharesmen, who tended to go to sea with family members. Fishermen from Gloucester, Massachusetts went to sea with family members on a more routine basis than did workers from other colonial ports. Work in the cod fisheries also extended and deepened pre-existing, land-based neighborly friendships. In short, colonial maritime laborers experienced the fraternity of the sea as much or more than the isolation of the sea. Research fellowships at the Massachusetts Historical Society and the James Duncan Phillips Library at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts yielded crew lists for commercial cod fishing expeditions between 1750 and 1775. These crew lists provide the statistical data for the quantification of kinship ties in this essay. The lists were largely drawn from ledger books that belonged to colonial shipowners and employers. Rare logbooks belonging to skippers on eighteenth-century cod fishing expeditions provided observations of various types of friendship at sea. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
Este trabajo examina la naturaleza de la familia y la amistad entre los pescadores comerciales del Massachusetts colonial durante las dos d√©cadas anteriores a la Revoluci√≥n Americana. Los historiadores tienden a enfatizar en exceso el grado de separaci√≥n entre los hombres y sus hogares y comunidades que el trabajo mar√≠timo significaba. Se dice que los marineros mercantes en rutas de larga distancia, los balleneros, los pescadores del bacalao e incluso los marinos de guerra, viv√≠an vidas separadas de los que estaban en tierra. Pero todos los marineros experimentaron en todas parte el mismo grado de aislamiento? Los pescadores coloniales que trabajaron en las pesquer√≠as de bacalao de Massachusetts en el siglo XVIII no. Los capitanes estaban m√°s aislados que los tripulantes, que tendieron a ir al mar con miembros de su familia. Los pescadores de Gloucester, Massachusetts iban al mar con miembros de su familia de una forma m√°s rutinaria que los trabajadores e otros puertos coloniales. El trabajo en las pesquer√≠as del bacalao, adem√°s, ampliaba e intensificaba amistades previas forjadas en tierra. En resumen, los trabajadores mar√≠timos coloniales experimentaron la fraternidad del mar tanto o m√°s que el aislamiento del mar. Estancias de investigaci√≥n en la Sociedad Hist√≥rica de Massachusetts y en la Biblioteca James Duncan Phillips en el Museo Peabody Essex de Salem, Massachusetts, permitieron obtener las listas de tripulaci√≥n para las expediciones comerciales de pesca de bacalao entre 1750 y 1775. Esta fuente proporciona los datos estad√≠sticos para la cuantifiaci√≥n de los lazos familiares que se ofrece en este trabajo. Las listas se confeccionaron mayoritariamente a partir de los libros de contabilidad que pertenecieron a navieros y patronos coloniales. Algunos escasos diarios de navegaci√≥n pertenecientes a capitanes de expediciones de pesca de bacalao en el siglo XVIII proporcionan observaciones de varios tipos de amistad en el mar.

Cet article examine les liens familiaux et amicaux au sein des √©quipages de la p√™che commerciale dans le Massachusetts de l'√©poque coloniale pendant les deux d√©cennies qui pr√©c√®dent la R√©volution am√©ricaine. Les historiens ont tendance √† exag√©rer la s√©paration que le travail en mer imposait aux hommes vis-√†-vis de leur maison et de leur communaut√©. On di souvent que les √©quipages de la marine marchande au long cours, les chasseurs de baleine, les p√™cheurs de morue voire les √©quipages des navires de guerre, menaient des vies s√©par√©es de celles de ceux qui restaient √† terre. Tous les marins faisaient-ils pour autant partout la m√™me exp√©rience d'isolement? Il semble que ce ne fut pas le cas des p√™cheurs du Massachusetts colonial au XVIIIe si√®cle. Les capitaines √©taient plus isol√©s que les marins, qui avaient l'habitude de prendre la mer avec des membres de leur famille. Les p√™cheurs de Gloucester, dans le Massachusetts, sortaient en mer avec des membres de leur famille de mani√®re plus r√©guli√®re que ceux des autres ports de l'√©poque coloniale. De m√™me, le travail dans les p√™cheries de morue √©largissait et approfondissait la fraternit√© en mer autant voire plus que l'isolement li√© √† la mer. Des bourses de recherche de la Massachusetts Historical Society et de la James Duncan Phillips Library au sein du Peabody Essex Museum √† Salem, dans le Massachusetts, ont permis de disposer de listes des √©quipages pour des exp√©ditions de p√™che commerciale √† la morue de 1750 √† 1775. Ces listes d'√©quipage fournissent des donn√©es statistiques utilis√©es dans cet article pour quantifier les liens familiaux au sein des √©quipages. Ces listes ont √©t√© largement tir√©es des livres comptables des armateurs et employeurs de l'√©poque coloniale. Quelques rares journaux de bord du XVIIIe si√®cle, appartenant aux capitaines des exp√©ditions de p√™che √† la morue, fournissent des observations sur diff√©rentes manifestations d'amiti√© en mer.

Dieser Aufsatz untersucht den Charakter von Familie und Freundschaft unter den Fischern in der Kolonie Massachusetts w√§hrend der zwei Jahrzehnte vor der Amerikanischen Revolution. Historiker neigen dazu, das Ausma√ü, in dem Arbeit auf See die M√§nner von Heim und Gemeinde trennte, zu √ºbersch√§tzen. Seeleute in der Handelsmarine auf Fernfahrt, Walf√§nger, Kabeljaufischer und sogar Marinesoldaten lebten angeblich ein Leben, getrennt von den Menschen an Land. Aber erfuhren alle Seeleute √ºberall den gleichen Grad der Isolation? Kabeljaufischer der Kolonie Massachusetts des 18. Jahrhunderts jedenfalls nicht. Selbst√§ndige Schiffer waren isolierter als Teilhaber, die meistens mit Familienmitgliedern zur See fuhren. Fischer aus Gloucester aus Massachusetts fuhren h√§ufiger mit Familienmitgliedern zur See als jene von anderen Kolonialh√§fen. Die Arbeit in der Kabeljaufischerei erweiterte und vertiefte au√üerdem Nachbarfreundschaften auf dem Lande, die es bereits vorher gegeben hatte. Kurz gesagt, Schiffer der Kolonien erfuhren die Br√ºderschaft der See viel deutlicher als die Isolation. Forschungsteams der Massachusetts Historical Society und der James Duncan Phillips Library am Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, legten Mannschaftslisten f√ºr kommerzielle Kabeljaufischz√ºge zwischen 1750 und 1775 vor. Diese Mannschaftslisten bieten die statistischen Daten f√ºr die Quantifizierung von famili√§ren Bindungen in diesem Aufsatz. Die Listen wurden haupts√§chlich aus den Unterlagen der kolonialen Reeder und Arbeitgeber gewonnen. Seltene Logb√ºcher von Kabeljaufischern des 18.Jahrhunderts erm√∂glichten zus√§tzliche Betrachtungen von verschiedenen Typen der Freundschaft auf See. (German) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

It argues that it is precisely because Atlantic history has been constructed from fundamentally Eurocentric categories like transatlantic empire and commerce that it has accorded little space to Amerindians. It points to this absence as an important shortcoming of such approaches, and suggests that Atlantic history will have to be reconceptualized in fundamental ways in order to bring Amerindians fully into the picture as historical actors.},

He shows how garbage affects residents in vulnerable communities and poses health risks to those who dispose of it. He follows the trash, the pollution, the hazards, and the people who encountered them in the period 1880-2000. What unfolds is a tug of war among social movements, government, and industry over how we manage our waste, who benefits, and who pays the costs.Studies demonstrate that minority and low-income communities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental hazards. Pellow analyzes how and why environmental inequalities are created. He also explains how class and racial politics have influenced the waste industry throughout the history of Chicago and the United States. After examining the roles of social movements and workers in defining, resisting, and shaping garbage disposal in the United States, he concludes that some environmental groups and people of color have actually contributed to environmental inequality.By highlighting conflicts over waste dumping, incineration, landfills, and recycling, Pellow provides a historical view of the garbage industry throughout the life cycle of waste. Although his focus is on Chicago, he places the trends and conflicts in a broader context, describing how communities throughout the United States have resisted the waste industry's efforts to locate hazardous facilities in their backyards. The book closes with suggestions for how communities can work more effectively for environmental justice and safe, sustainable waste management.},

	abstract = {This article statistically analyzes quantitative data from numerous sources in order to assess changes in marriage patterns, family structure, and rates of social mobility during the period from 1282 to 1494. During this period, three systems of social stratification coexisted ‚Äî wealth, political office, and age of family‚Äîbut these contending status systems were not consistent in their rankings of families. Each status system was conservative in the sense that elite families at the top of that hierarchy married each other in order to stabilize their position. But because of inconsistency in rankings, contradiction within the elite opened up the Florentine marriage system to widespread upward social mobility by new men. In their own families, successful new men aggressively imitated their economically and politically declining status superiors. Sharp class divisions thereby blurred into continuous and negotiable status gradients. These open-elite patterns of social mobility, present throughout the early Florentine Renaissance, were most extreme during the Albizzi regime, immediately following the Ciompi Revolt.

	shorttitle = {Founding {Families}},
	abstract = {This dissertation highlights French and Native contributions to Detroit's development in the eighteenth century as one of the busiest and most politically and economically pivotal locations in the continental interior. The focus of this study are the "m√©tis family networks," a group of tightly interrelated mixed-blood kinship conglomerates of French and Native individuals. Members of these networks hailed predominantly from the Great Lakes, Montreal and the Laurentian Valley, but their commercial activities took them to Boston, New York, Louisiana, Hudson's Bay, and in some cases, England, France, and Holland. They capitalized on their role as imperial representatives and emissaries to amass considerable prestige and personal fortune, becoming "coureurs de ville" or "runners of the city." Their activities in this regard at Detroit made it a bustling thoroughfare, through which resources flowed east and west. By the mid-eighteenth century, they had become so powerful, incoming British traders and imperial officials courted their favor and influence among Native nations. As a topic of study in the history of early North American Native-European relations, Detroit has until recently been ignored. This is due to a historiographical divide between U.S. and Canadian renditions of colonial America which have artificially parsed out geographies according to nineteenth century concepts of nation that did not exist in the eighteenth century. For this reason, this dissertation begins by examining how renditions of Detroit's past written in the nineteenth century sacrificed nuanced depictions of French and Native early history to fit Detroit into a prevailing national story, marginalizing the significant contributions of these two groups. This author utilizes Anglo-Canadian, French- Canadian, American, and Native historiographies to reassemble what has been artificially separated since the nineteenth century. The reader is then introduced to themes, concepts, and pivotal seventeenth and eighteenth century imperial policy decisions that were the backdrop for the development of the m√©tis family networks, including the roles of women and mothers in French and Native worlds, imperial attitudes to race and gender, and metaphors of kinship. One chapter is a microhistory of these family networks, tracing their travels, activities, and kinship ties across the continent and, at times, the Atlantic Ocean to show their geographic, political, and economic range. The story also concentrates on the extensive role of women in the transformation of members of the networks into the bourgeois coureurs de ville who would control the fur trade in the pays d'en haut by mid century. These women were married to, born of, or siblings of men who were similarly highly mobile due to their participation in the trade with Native groups. The trade also exposed French women to alternative gendered arrangements and notions of domesticity in Native communities. French women mimicked the manners of Iroquoian and Algonquian women, who moved their homes and families to seasonal hunting and in reaction to agricultural demands. Combined with the rapidly increasing ability of merchants in New France to control policy-making due to the state's dependency on their business activities, the women of the networks had unprecedented opportunities to participate at every level. The dissertations ends when the winds of change from rebellious American colonists meeting in the first continental congress in the east threatened British hegemony and caused British imperial agents to lean more heavily on Great Lakes Native groups for support. This is also the year the Quebec Act was passed, which constituted, among other things, a concession by the British, fifteen years after the Conquest, to some aspects of the culture of m√©tis populations. It was in 1774 that the troubled marriage of one Native woman and one French man came under the scrutiny of British imperial agents at all levels, from the local commandant at Detroit to Thomas Gage, Commander-in-Chief of British troops in North America and governor of Massachusetts. Such attention to one marriage and one family is rare in the administrative records of imperial powers, but this was no ordinary marriage. Because it involved members of an extremely powerful m√©tis network, resolving the domestic disputes of one married couple held the potential for the resolution of the larger domestic dispute brewing between the British and their colonists.},

	abstract = {The goal of this dissertation is the explication of some aspects of the fur trade in eighteenth century New France. From an analysis of the written historical and documentary evidence a model representing the French colonial fur trade system of the eighteenth century as a network of hierarchically organized bases has been developed. These bases were posts within a military organization and their primary function was to facilitate the operation of the fur trade. The posts in the French fur trade network were characterized by differing levels of functional complexity. These differences evolved as the fur trade network expanded into the North American wilderness, away from French sources of supply and command, and closer to native American Indian tribes.  The thesis of the dissertation is that the differences described in the model should be discernible in the patterning of archaeological remains at French fur trade sites. It is tested through the examination of the differential distribution of artifacts at several archaeological sites. The data available and/or suitable for use in this study were not sufficient to allow the analysis of all levels within the hierarchy. Of the French fur trade sites that have been excavated only two, Fort Ouiatenon and Fort Michilimackinac could be compared. Because of the differences between the data sets from the two sites, the sensitivity with which statements about the fur trade system could be made was somewhat reduced.  Nonetheless, interesting similarities and differences between the two sites have been perceived. As a Regional Distribution Center, Fort Michilimackinac emerges as a more diversified post, occupied by more people of greater affluence, status than Fort Ouiatenon, and a more militarily important post. Ouiatenon, a Local Distribution Center, appears not only as a smaller and less affluent post, but one where more emphasis was necessarily placed on making do with local resources. Similarities between the two posts are more striking and may be related to the ultimate economic function of posts within the French fur trade system.},

Chronological placement is supported by a number of radiocarbon assays, but multiple intercepts on the radiocarbon correction scale throughout the 14th century preclude a radiocarbon-based internal chronology. The Bold Counselor phase is known from surface collections and a number of well-preserved residential and mortuary features at only a handful of sites. Although Bold Counselor phase is easily linked to other developmental horizon Oneota phases, its close associations with Late Mississippian culture make it unique among Oneota manifestations. The indisputable cohabitation of the Bold Counselor phase people and local Late Mississippians at several sites is perhaps the most distinctive feature of Bold Counselor phase.},

	abstract = {The place of New Orleans in the greater Atlantic world has shifted significantly since its founding in the early 18th century. Long a favored site of human habitation and adaptation to Louisiana's coastal environments and a strategic mediation point between bayou, river, lake, and seaborne commerce and travel, the city's fortunes have been in part determined by its location. This article proposes that "time-geographic" analysis be applied to aggregate formations - in this case, one of the Atlantic world's most distinctive cities, New Orleans. Fernand Braudel's "conjunctural" category of half-century spans offers the appropriate metric for measuring and marking this flow. The year of the Louisiana Purchase, 1803, can be taken as the key datum point. Taking the pulse of New Orleans' site and situation at fifty-year intervals prior to and after 1803 provides a conjunctural geohistory that says much about the city but also about the relations with its Mississippian hinterland and its Gulf/Caribbean forelands.

Preston details the ways in which European and Iroquois settlers on the frontiers creatively adapted to each other‚Äôs presence, weaving webs of mutually beneficial social, economic, and religious relationships that sustained the peace for most of the eighteenth century.¬†Drawing on a wealth of previously unexamined archival research, Preston describes everyday encounters between Europeans and Indians along the frontiers of the Iroquois Confederacy in the St. Lawrence, Mohawk, Susquehanna, and Ohio valleys. Homesteads, taverns, gristmills, churches, and markets were frequent sites of intercultural exchange and negotiation. Complex diplomatic and trading relationships developed as a result of European and Iroquois settlers bartering material goods. Innovative land-sharing arrangements included the common practice of Euroamerican farmers living as tenants of the Mohawks, sometimes for decades. This study reveals that the everyday lives of Indians and Europeans were far more complex and harmonious than past histories have suggested. Preston‚Äôs nuanced comparisons between various settlements also reveal the reasons why peace endured in the Mohawk and St. Lawrence valleys while warfare erupted in the Susquehanna and Ohio valleys.¬†One of the most comprehensive studies of eighteenth-century Iroquois history, The Texture of Contact broadens our understanding of eastern North America‚Äôs frontiers and the key role that the Iroquois played in shaping that world.},

	abstract = {Though the ritual of baptism occasioned impassioned debates about its effects and performance in the early modern period, most Christian groups agreed on its necessity. It signified the incorporation of each individual into a broad spiritual family, symbolized by the provision of a set of godparents who were chosen to underline and extend bonds of friendship and bring families to the attention of influential patrons. This article provides as full a picture as possible, given the relative scarcity of sources, of the ceremonies of baptism in use in Ireland between about 1530 and 1690. Consideration of the role of baptism and godparenthood in creating and reinforcing social connections - often, given the level of migration into early modern Ireland, newly instituted connections - offers greater understanding of the dynamics of community life in a rapidly changing society. But these ceremonies also reveal social and religious tensions because of their potential to highlight difference and promote ideas of denominational exclusivity and superiority.

	abstract = {In European societies of the past, godparenthood ties, strengthened by a special kind of kinship ("spiritual kinship"), had an important social role. "Godmotherhood," however, has many dark sides because it has often been assimilated to masculine godparenthood (if not completely neglected) despite having important specific characteristics. Before the Council of Trent, godmothers were thought to be less important than godfathers; in many Italian communities they were usually not present at baptism. It was the council that revalued godmothers by imposing a strict restriction to the acceptable number of godfathers that promoted the participation of women to complex systems of spiritual kinship. In this changing situation, the activity of godmothers is organized in a kind of "career" that regulates and conditions the progressive construction of a network of ties often integrated with that built by male counterparts (fathers or husbands).},

	abstract = {The Driftless Area of the Upper Midwestern United States offers a case study for the transition from hunter-gatherer (Late Woodland Effigy Mound) to agricultural (Oneota) societies between ca. A.D. 950 and 1150, a period that coincided with northward expansion of Middle Mississippian cultures from the American Bottom. Previous studies have not adequately explained the regional disappearance of Effigy Mound cultures, the appearance of Oneota cultures, or the cultural changes that occurred during this period. Our analysis considers ecological (deer and firewood) and cultural (population packing, community organization, hunting technology, and warfare) factors to develop a testable model applicable to broader regions. We propose that increasing Late Woodland populations reached the region's "packing threshold," disrupting a flexible seasonal round based on residential mobility and triggering shortages of two essential resources, white-tailed deer and firewood, which in turn led Late Woodland groups to abandon vast portions of the Driftless Area. The intrusion of Middle Mississippian peoples from the south created additional disruption and conflict. Remnant Woodland and Mississippian peoples amalgamated briefly in the region's first villages, which were palisaded. After A.D. 1150, Oneota cultures emerged, reoccupying specific localities in clustered settlements. /// El Area Driftless (una zona no cubierta por los glaciares) de la parte central del Norte de los Estados Unidos ofrece un ejemplo de la transici√≥n de una sociedad cazadora-recolectora (Woodland Effigy Mound Tard√≠o) a una sociedad agr√≠cola (Oneota) entre 1050 y 1150 d.C, un per√≠odo que coincidi√≥ con la expansi√≥n hacia el Norte de culturas Mississippian Medio del Sur Americano. Estudios anteriores no han explicado adecuadamente la desaparici√≥n regional de las culturas Effigy Mound, la aparici√≥n de las culturas Oneota, o los cambios culturales que ocurrieron durante este per√≠odo. Nuestro an√°lisis considera factores ecol√≥gicos (venado y le√±a) y culturales (densidad de poblaci√≥n, organizaci√≥n de comunidad, tecnolog√≠a de caza, y guerra) para desarrollar un modelo que se puede probar y que se puede aplicar a regiones m√°s extensas. Proponemos que las poblaciones Woodland Tard√≠o aumentaron hasta que llenaron la regi√≥n, rompiendo el patr√≥n flexible de movilidad estacional y causando escaseases de dos recursos esenciales, venado de cola blanca y le√±a. Esta situaci√≥n oblig√≥ a los grupos Woodland Tard√≠o a abandonar vastas extensiones del Area Driftless. La intrusi√≥n de grupos Mississippian del Sur cre√≥ trastornos y conflictos adicionales. Grupos remanentes Woodland y Mississippian se fusionaron brevemente en las primeras aldeas de la regi√≥n, que fueron empalizadas. Despu√©s del a√±o 1150 d.C. emergieron las culturas Oneota, reocupando localidades espec√≠ficas en asentamientos agrupados.},

	volume = {25},
	issn = {02684160},
	abstract = {This micro-study examines the Maltese parish of St Mary's (Qrendi) in the second half of the eighteenth century. First it will be argued that - as in many other contemporaneous communities - migration to other parishes made its population extremely fluid. A second interest lies in the extent to which social distinctions and unruly behaviour further disrupted village solidarity. Finally there will be a consideration of the thesis that such unstable elements were counterbalanced by various integrative ties that bound the Qrendin together, such as charity, the obligations of neighbourliness and an intense devotion to the parish, kinship and godparenthood. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
On observe d'abord, dans cette paroisse de Ste Marie de Qrendi, √† la fin du 18e si√®cle, comme dans nombre d'autres communaut√©s de l'√©poque, que les migrations de paroisse √† paroisse ont rendu la population extr√™mement fluide. Un second aspect digne d'int√©r√™t est une augmentation de la rupture des solidarit√©s villageoises due √† des diff√©renciations sociales et √† des comportements hors normes. Enfin nous prenons en consid√©ration l'id√©e selon laquelle, contre de tels facteurs d'instabilit√©, jouaient diff√©rents √©l√©ments de coh√©sion sociale favorisant l'int√©gration dans la communaut√© locale, tels que charit√©, obligations de voisinage, intense d√©votion √† la paroisse, √† la parent√© et aux rapports de parrainage. (French) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
Diese Mikrostudie untersucht die Gemeinde der Heiligen Maria in Qrendi in der zweiten H√§lfte des 18. Jahrhunderts. Zun√§chst wird darauf verwiesen, dass die Bev√∂lkerung - wie in vielen anderen Gemeinden zur selben Zeit - durch Wanderung in andere Gemeinden in st√§ndiger Bewegung war. Als n√§chstes geht es um die Frage, inwiefern die Dorfgemeinschaft durch soziale Abgrenzungen und widerspenstiges Verhalten zus√§tzlich zersetzt wurde. Schlie√ülich wird die These er√∂rtert, dass solche unstabilen Elemente durch verschiedene integrative Bande wie z.B. karitative Einrichtungen, die Verpflichtungen der Nachbarschaft und eine intensive Hingabe an Gemeinde, Verwandtschaft und Patenschaft, die allesamt zum Zusammenhalt Qrendin beitrugen, aufgewogen wurden.

A muddied view of the remarkable changes that occurred within the cultural landscape of Illinois is the result. European goods first appear in the region between 1580 and 1630 and the pottery of the Illinois Indians‚Äîthe Danner series‚Äîis present in each early Illinois sample that includes these imports. A reexamination of the Zimmerman, Palos, and Oak Forest sites suggests that temporal changes in trade good assemblages can be better understood in the context of historically documented trade schedules. Further, it is argued that the Illinois Indians actively positioned themselves in the political and economic landscape of the fur trade many decades prior to the arrival of the French in the Illinois Country, serving as the principal agents of the great changes that are associated with protohistory in Illinois.},

Class revolt and fisical crisis were the ultimate causes of elite consolidation, but Medicean political control was produced by means of network disjunctures within the elite, which the Medici alone spanned. Cosimo de' Medici's multivocal identity as sphinx harnessed the power available in these network holes and resolved the contradiction between judge and boss inherent in all organizations. Methodologically, we argue that to understand state formation one must penetrate beneath the veneer of formal institutions, groups, and goals down to the relational substrata of peoples' actual lives. Ambiguity and heterogeneity, not planning and self- interest, are the raw materials of which powerful states and persons are constructed.},

By focusing on ethnogenesis as the product of the local as well as the global, we have sought to put the experiences of Africans and Amerindians at the center of Atlantic history.

	abstract = {Relying on meticulous original archival research, historian Peter Silver uncovers a fearful and vibrant early America in which Lutherans and Presbyterians, Quakers, Catholics and Covenanters, Irish, German, French, and Welsh all sought to lay claim to a daunting countryside. Such groups had rarely intermingled in Europe, and the divisions between them only grew--until, with the arrival of the Seven Years' War, thousands of country people were forced to flee from Indian attack.Silver reveals in vivid and often chilling detail how easily a rhetoric of fear can incite entire populations to violence. He shows how it was only through the shared experience of fearing and hating Indians that these Europeans, once irreconcilable, were finally united under the ideal of religious and ethnic tolerance that has since defined the best in American life.},

A comparison of these vernacular definitions with the results of archaeological excavations at two creole sites in New Orleans helps define three types of creolization: transplantation, ethnic acculturation, and hybridization. These are transitions that occurred in the self-fashioning of Louisianans as expressed through their houses, gardens, clothes, food, and household goods. Adopting a native perspective exposes the roles that worldview and individual agency play in shaping processes of cultural change. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

It argues that, despite the wealth of scholarship being done on Native peoples and the growing awareness of that work in the wider field of early American studies, understanding of the Indians‚Äô experience, of their place in early America‚Äîand therefore of early America itself‚Äîis still handicapped by historians‚Äô use of an archaic, Eurocentric vocabulary. A look at some of the scholarship published since the turn of the millennium suggests how pervasive and pernicious this biased terminology remains, and how it stands in the way of efforts to fathom that strange place conventionally called ‚Äúearly America.‚Äù},

the making of French Canada : a cultural history /
Language: English
Contents: Cyrano de Bergerac's imaginary voyage to Canada: a survey of the colony -- Europeans and "the wild people": French-Amerindian relations -- Scepter and Main de justice: government ambitions to create a renewed France in North America -- The difficulty of finding settlers for New France and the reluctant exile of Manon Lescaut's countrymen -- Sea voyagers and Bonhomme
Terreneuve: the newcomer's reception and appeals to come home -- Proud as a Canadien, stubborn as an Acadien: the emergence of new peoples -- Group and institutional loyalties: social rank, occupation, and parish -- The sovereign family -- Magic and religion in the colonists' world.
Abstract: "Moogk draws on a rich body of evidence - literature; statistical studies; government, legal, and private documents in France, Britain, and North America - to define the colonists' character. In so doing, he has discovered a New France vastly different from the one portrayed in popular history. Aboriginal people looked upon the first white newcomers with disdain rather than with awe. French relations with allied Native Peoples were not consistently harmonious, but were strained and fragile. Most immigrants to the colony were not rebels; they were reluctant exiles from their homeland, speaking various languages and French dialects, and a third or more returned to Europe. Even those who remained in North America were socially conservative and developed their own institutions only when government neglect permitted it. The monarchy and Roman Catholicism molded attitudes and were as important as language in defining Acadian and Franco-Canadian identities. Moogk did not find a single entity called New France but a chain of loosely connected outposts stretching from Newfoundland in the east to the Illinois Country in the west. Yet the shared experience of being in the French Bourbon empire marked modern French Canada and, in particular, the Province of Quebec. La Nouvelle France is a starting point for understanding Quebec nationalism and the cultural values that give rise to it."--BOOK JACKET.

	  Eighteenth-century primary sources depict a number of group sexual attacks on southeastern Indian women by Indian men as punishment for adultery. To maintain that these events were the result of adultery is problematic, as all modern scholarship provides evidence that Native women had significant status, authority, and freedom, especially regarding sexual matters. This article reexamines these sources and suggests that the events were not a result of any Euro-American concept of adultery. Instead, it presents some alternative explanations that are more in accordance with Indian tradition as opposed to European social conventions, while simultaneously shedding further light on the lives of Native American women.},

	abstract = {"The Business of Politics" analyzes the relationship between commercial print networks and the circulation of political news in the decade before the American Revolution. It argues that printers were crucial to the development of an intercolonial infrastructure for political communications. As publishers of political news and men whose commercial interests were affected by imperial policy, printers were at the hub of political and commercial networks that included other artisans, merchants, and political leaders. Oral, manuscript, and printed forms of political communication intersected in the printers' shops, where printers repackaged them into printed newspapers, pamphlets, and almanacs through which political news and opinion traveled around the colonies. Printers and their political allies gradually built up an intercolonial system of communications that included several layers: the spectrum of print media that printers produced; the various modes of transportation, such as the Post Office, private carriers, and networks of individual travelers that distributed unpublished and published political communications; and the spaces where political news, debate, and opinions took shape, including the printing office, the post office, coffee houses, libraries, bookshops, and taverns. Printers stood at the nexus of this emerging infrastructure.
"The Business of Politics" is based on a voluminous archive of print materials, but it also uses manuscript correspondence, business records, and other papers of printers and their associates in order to reconstruct their commercial networks and political alliances. The dissertation comprises five chapters that chronicle the development of these networks during the decade of imperial crisis. It pays particular attention to moments of crisis such as the Stamp Act crisis, the protests against tea, the formation of a new American post office, and the beginning of the Revolutionary War, in order to demonstrate the central role of printers in shaping a coherent resistance movement and the rationale for it. Through an analysis of printers' strategies throughout the imperial crisis, "The Business of Politics" forges a new narrative of the American Revolution that synthesizes commercial and political interests in understanding the formation of intercolonial communications.},

	abstract = {Based on seventeenth- and eighteenth-century accounts written by and for slavers, this article investigates the provisioning of the French Middle Passage. As the transatlantic trade in African captives developed, foodstuffs for the feeding of both Europeans and Africans figured prominently in a specifically Atlantic system of commodity exchanges. The trade in foodstuffs depended most heavily on African subsistence systems encountered along the coasts of West Africa, but a surprising quantity of French and other European foodstuffs were embarked specifically for the Middle Passage, revealing, I argue, the precariousness of conditions of trade and of European slaving factories. As a key element of Atlantic political economy, the study of food and its transatlantic provisioning networks sheds light not only on the governance and regulation of the networks themselves, but also on the ability of early modern states to establish and maintain metropolitan control, on the growth of local, colonial forms of autonomy and authority, and on the complex systems of ‚Äònational‚Äô and colonial interdependence that lay behind the expansion of every Atlantic colony. I conclude that this study of provisioning demonstrates that however fractured and differentiated, imperial power was an irrefutable aspect of colonial continuity.},

These relations were, however, deeply responsive to the international context and to warfare in particular. American shipping to France experienced an extraordinary boom after the outbreak of war between France and Great Britain in 1793. The paper explores the nature of this trade and demonstrates that its full understanding requires a global approach to trade flows in the Atlantic World rather than the bilateral approaches which dominate contemporary as well as most historical analyses. A broader analysis must integrate merchant strategies and networks into the Atlantic history.

(3) The authors seek alternatives to traditional approaches focusing on the nation-state and its institutions. Instead, they examine communities and regions in the Atlantic that include social elites, such as, merchants, the nobility, the gentry, and intellectuals, as well as neglected native peoples and forgotten spaces such as Africa.},

They were often determinative of national imperial expansion. Thus, the success of exports and imports were not necessarily judged on Atlantic crossings but rather on the supply and demand of national or European economies. Commerce did not end on the seashore, in a port, or even in a contraband network, but often deep within a nation‚Äôs hinterlands.},

However, this article explores how, in the second half of the eighteenth century, Africa emerged as a viable alternative for colonial expansion. Uncertainties about a colonial future in the New World directed French expansionist attention away from the Americas and towards the African continent, expanding its role beyond a source of labour. The intellectual underpinnings for a transfer of empire first surfaced within the Physiocratic School of political economy. The article examines the emergence of such ideas and their reception within the colonial administration of the Ancien R√©gime. It also shows how expansion into Africa became central to the imperial agenda of the first French Republic. Exploring Africa as a substitute to colonial America helps expand the lens through which Africa is examined as part of the Atlantic World. It also reveals continuities between Ancien R√©gime colonialism and later French republican imperialism.},

The presence of French nobles in New France or in the French West Indies and the emergence of the native gentry in parts of the British Empire have been much studied. But the social impact of elites has not been fully recognized by Atlantic historians‚Äîdue, perhaps, to a bias towards ‚Äúauthentically‚Äù New World systems of social recognition based upon wealth, emphasizing supposedly greater possibilities of social mobility. This paper takes a comparative perspective to the social meanings of being a noble or being a gentleman in both empires. It concludes that there were few substantive differences between French nobles living in the metropolis and in the colonies because legal definitions of the French noblesse were strictly determined by the Crown. The essence of the French nobility was, in theory, the same in Versailles, in a remote rural parish of France or in Quebec. The story was very different for British colonial gentlemen who encountered countless difficulties to be socially accepted by their metropolitan counterparts. The paper explores the consequences of the chasm between British metropolitan and colonial upper classes and assesses solutions taken by colonial gentlemen to be fully integrated in the gentry of Great Britain.},

When closely analyzed, however, daily merchant practice does not fit easily into regional categories, whether Atlantic or imperial. Merchant life was heavily dependent on the building of chains of trusted correspondents, who would both be able to guarantee adequate quality and satisfactory pricing upon acquisition or sale of the goods traded, and willing to extend credit in a trading world in which all operations included long time lags before final payment. For each trading center, the addition of such chains of correspondents constituted networks both supra-regional, covering the entire world, and sub-regional, specializing in some areas more than others according to prevalent political-imperial pressures. It is argued that the common element in all these networks, i.e. merchant development, is best identified as a worldwide, but Europe-dominated social process underpinning much of what is usually meant by ‚ÄúAtlantic‚Äù history.},

        √¢¬Ä¬úA Good Relationship, \& Commerce√¢¬Ä¬ù The Native Political Economy of the Arkansas River Valley KATHLEEN DUVAL McNeil Center for Early American Studies In 1680, a combined delegation of Quapaw and Osage Indians who lived north of the Arkansas River and Chickasaws from near present-day Memphis traveled up the Mississippi River to the French mission at Kaskaskia. These Indians had heard that the French would provide weapons and tools in exchange for animal skins. To demonstrate their affability and signal that trade to the south could be profitable, the delegation presented deerskins and other hides to the Frenchmen at Kaskaskia. As the delegates hoped, the French gave them a large number of hatchets but, to their disappointment, no guns. Beyond their own deerskins, the delegates offered to broker trade in the region. They told the French that the Mississippi was navigable to the Gulf of Mexico and invited them to come to their towns so that their people could introduce the French to the other nations of the lower Mississippi River and all could √¢¬Ä¬údance the Calumet of peace.√¢¬Ä¬ù Above all, the delegates declared, they wanted to √¢¬Ä¬úmaintain a good relationship, \& commerce with the French Nation.√¢¬Ä¬ù1 Although Indians soliciting European trade sounds like a colonialist fantasy, these seventeenth-century Indians believed that the French could serve their interests. We know now that Europeans, with their diseases, liquor, trade systems, and shady land deals, would bring disaster to the native peoples of the Americas. One might be tempted to caution the delegates: √¢¬Ä¬úKill them, run away, do whatever it takes to avoid being drawn into their world, to the future 1. R. P.

Deliberately, the Indian delegation told the French exactly what would draw them to the lower Mississippi Valley. With a united front, the Quapaws, Osages, and Chickasaws promised an environment of peace, abundant hides, and a river that would easily carry those hides to sea. By no means a concession to colonialism, their meeting in Kaskaskia was part of a consistent strategy for controlling the region themselves. The Arkansas Valley had seen conflict and migration long before Spaniards arrived from the south, French from the north, and, in the eighteenth century, British from the east. By 1000 A.D., most residents of the Arkansas Valley lived within a chiefdom or a confederation, and these groupings allied or fought with other allied peoples. Over the centuries, chiefdoms and cities rose and fell, and peoples expanded, contracted, and moved as political, economic, and environmental circumstances changed.2 The transformations that occurred when Europeans arrived, as devastating as they could be, were simply a new chapter in a long history of change in the region. As in other parts of the Americas, European diseases and weapons changed the balance of power in the Arkansas Valley, creating opportunities for some native peoples and debilitating or destroying others. In the late sixteenth century, disease, probably combined with natural disasters, caused major upheavals in the societies around the Arkansas River. By the time of the Quapaws√¢¬Ä¬ô and Osages√¢¬Ä¬ô visit to Kaskaskia in 1680, European diseases had transformed the Arkansas Valley, and a new trade good, guns, threatened to...},

On the basis of court records, Indians were largely excluded from French jurisdiction. They were never sentenced in a regular procedure, and they never considered the French system of justice a way to solve their internal problems. Furthermore, some traditional Indian ways of conflict resolution were accepted by the French magistrates and adopted into colonial judicial proceedings.},

As Tocqueville noted two centuries ago, some elements of European culture, not all of them, made their way across the ocean. Religion, which figures so prominently in contemporary debates about transatlantic relations, is a case in point. While pre-Enlightenment conceptions of the religious formed the core of the American national ethos, secularist notions so dominant in ‚Äúpost-Christian‚Äù Europe today are much less prevalent in the New World, accounting for the growing gap between European and American public opinions on issues such as abortion, the death penalty, religious dress in public schools or the separation of Church and State.},

	abstract = {This study begins with the Treaty of Paris in 1763. The cession of French territories in North America redrew the geopolitical landscape. However, this dissertation argues that geopolitical change was not representative of, nor did it immediately alter, existing social and economic realities. The French Empire in North America had come to an end, but a sizable French-speaking population remained in both the St. Lawrence and Mississippi Valleys, and throughout the Great Lakes region. Over the next forty years, as the British, Spanish, and Americans carved up the former French territories, they were forced to confront the French-speaking population in the heart of North America. In the midst of regular geopolitical upheaval and instability, I posit that French socio-economic connections continued to tie French-speaking regions together to form a French river world. More specifically, this dissertation examines socio-economic continuity in the portion of the French river world between the St. Lawrence and middle Mississippi Valleys from 1763 to 1803. Early migration patterns saw Canadiens from the St. Lawrence Valley marry into established French-speaking families in the middle Mississippi Valley in the l740s. These migration and marriage patterns continued after 1763. They helped connect seemingly disparate French-speaking regions together and kept a broader geographical understanding of French North America at the forefront of living memory. Merchants like Gabriel Cerr√© traveled back and forth between the two regions, setting up extended networks of communication and exchange through strategic marriage alliances designed to facilitate trade. However, merchants did more than simply conduct trade, as they also helped people to handle their personal affairs over long distances. Nowhere was this more visible than in the frequent use of third party representation to handle family succession rights. Merchants and voyageurs became cultural conduits through which French-speaking families stayed connected. Thus, the French river world was both imagined and real, as a product of the lived experiences of merchants and voyageurs and the imaginings of those they represented. Both combined to form a socially constructed mental map, which was mutable and fluid. However, by the end of the eighteenth century, the socio-economic linkages that had helped maintain the French river world slowly began to degrade. Access to British markets and capital, which had initially helped reinforce the commercial networks of the French river world, ultimately undermined long-term social cohesion. The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 ushered in a new era as waves of American migration radically changed the demographic composition of the middle Mississippi Valley. Yet, even as French bourgeois in places like St. Louis shifted their attention towards the construction of mid-America the networks of the French river world were slow to fade. The American Fur Company hired over one thousand Canadien voyageurs out of Montreal for voyages to St. Louis and the limits of Missouri fur trade, keeping elements of the French river world afloat until the 1830s.},

	abstract = {This dissertation examines a substantial yet forgotten French colony that was located where the cities of Detroit and Windsor stand today. It is generally assumed by colonial historians that Fort Pontchartrain (later known as Fort Detroit), built by Antoine Laumet de La Mothe Cadillac in 1701, remained up until the War of 1812 a mere military/fur trading post where French fur traders married Indian women.
Firstly, this work demonstrates that, in fact, the King of France had claimed the Detroit River region as part of his Royal Domain in 1682 and that, on his behalf, French colonial administrators had established a "directe seigneurie" there in 1734. In this type of seigneurie, rare in New France, the seigneur was not a prominent colonist or a Catholic order but the King himself. Yet it used an identical system of land tenure. This directe seigneurie rapidly promoted French territorial occupation and by the late 1750s dozens of long and narrow farms, as in the seigneuries of the St. Lawrence valley, covered more than 25 kilometres of the frontage of the Detroit River. After the British conquest, unlike the seigneuries of the St. Lawrence valley, the directe seigneurie of Detroit was left with no seigneur since the King of France had virtually lost all the territories he had claimed in North America. In 1763, Britain's Royal Proclamation prohibited colonization in the Great Lakes region until treaties of land cession with Indians were signed. British officials tried to contain the growth of the French colony of the Detroit River region but by the 1770s its residents, who could no longer be confined to the lands they already occupied, ignored the Royal Proclamation and made arrangements with their Indian neighbours to obtain deeds to new parcels of land along different rivers of the area. In 1796, the Detroit River became an international border separating southwest Upper Canada from the southeast portion of Michigan Territory, created in 1805. By 1797 and 1807, once treaties of land cession with Indians had begun to be signed, Upper Canada and Michigan Territory set up commissions to clarify the question of land titles of the colonists within their respective jurisdictions. In the Detroit River region, these commissions collectively granted land titles to more than 500 French families whose properties, surveyed by the commissioners, all had long and narrow shapes. Throughout the following decades though, the French families who lived within the city limits of Detroit and Windsor were progressively forced to sell their land titles under the pressure of urbanization. Still, the brief existence of the directe seigneurie and its heritage had helped the French population of the Detroit River region to increase from about 500 to 7,000 people between the 1750s and the 1810s.
Secondly, this dissertation exhibits that the French who colonized the Detroit River region also symbolized their long-term commitment to the territory by transforming the landscape through the planting of orchards of apple, pear, peach, and plum trees on their properties. When Anglo-Americans migrated to that region in the early nineteenth century they were impressed by the old French orchards they encountered, to the point that many newcomers described them in travel narratives. However, as a result of urbanization, these French orchards largely disappeared from the landscape by the early twentieth century.
Thirdly, this research reveals that French-Indian intermarriage remained fairly limited in the Detroit colony, especially compared to other posts of the Great Lakes, where French colonial administrators had not established directes seigneuries. Cultural m√©tissage between French and Indians in the Detroit River region was prevalent, but it did not bind the destinies of the two groups together.},

Operating outside European control and hidden from European eyes, these networks' existence and importance have been assumed but never fully explicated. This article explores some of these inter- and intra-Indian connections. Rooted in the Lower Creek town of Coweta and analyzing sources from the vantage point of Indian country, it shows some of the different ways in which Creek Indians remained informed of and connected to developments in the colonial Southeast. Exploring the networks forged by one particular Indian chief‚ÄîBrims, Mico of Coweta‚Äîhelps evince the breadth and extent of information channels among native people. The information networks linked, modified, and influenced by Brims show more than the movement of news; they offer insight into the power structures that shaped the colonial Southeast.},

	abstract = {"Reckoning" revisits an old story--the meeting of cultures in the colonial northeast--from a new perspective: communications. Descriptions of early New England often conjure images of orderly Puritan towns, with Indians and others pushed to society's edges. But New England was not just a patchwork of walled-off pastures and plots. It had an alternate, human geography as well--a geography of letters, travelers, and movement. Using diaries, travel literature, almanacs, court records, war narratives, and a database of nearly 3,000 letters, I track travelers and news across the northeast from roughly the 1630s to the 1670s. Through that reconstruction, I reinterpret some of the defining moments of colonization (including the Pequot War, the Anglo-Dutch War, and King Philip's War) as contests to control communications. Ultimately, "Reckoning" uses the study of communications to unearth unseen contingencies, vulnerabilities, and travails involved in the making of the English northeast.
The English quest to control the northeast entailed a great struggle to control the flow of information over space. For decades, English colonists were the losers in this struggle. Despite its reputation as one of the most stolid bastions of English settlement, the northeast was in fact a precarious borderland in which colonists largely avoided overland travel and even relied on Algonquians to send news. But the 1660s marked a great tipping point, in which the power balance shifted significantly in their favor. Tracing this trajectory, I use New England's story to revisit longstanding assumptions about encounter, empire, and colonial power.
Travel and communications, in fact, provide uncannily strong barometers of power. Who could travel where, who ruled the routes winding through the woods, who dictated what news might be sent--These things, I argue, tell as much about power and geographic authority as any deed or document. Gaining control of New England was not solely a matter of consuming territory, of transforming woods into farms. It also meant mastering the lines of communication. Even ordinary vestiges of colonization--horses, postal service, roads--acted as vectors of conquest. With their bodies, with their very feet, colonists marked the bounds of English New England.},

This article examines that growing body of literature, focusing on works that deal with the complex relationships among indigenous peoples, French colonists, and the French state. We argue that these books, articles, and dissertations point toward a new vision of the early modern French Atlantic. Rejecting older notions of a static, moribund monarchy opposed by dynamic colonial societies that flouted the crown‚Äôs designs, recent studies instead examine points of connection between a multi-faceted state and the peoples it engaged, creating a more nuanced portrait of early modern French colonialism.},

	abstract = {The first and only successful slave revolution in the Americas began in 1791 when thousands of brutally exploited slaves rose up against their masters on Saint-Domingue, the most profitable colony in the eighteenth-century Atlantic world. Within a few years, the slave insurgents forced the French administrators of the colony to emancipate them, a decision ratified by revolutionary Paris in 1794. This victory was a stunning challenge to the order of master/slave relations throughout the Americas, including the southern United States, reinforcing the most fervent hopes of slaves and the worst fears of masters.But, peace eluded Saint-Domingue as British and Spanish forces attacked the colony. A charismatic ex-slave named Toussaint Louverture came to France's aid, raising armies of others like himself and defeating the invaders. Ultimately Napoleon, fearing the enormous political power of Toussaint, sent a massive mission to crush him and subjugate the ex-slaves. After many battles, a decisive victory over the French secured the birth of Haiti and the permanent abolition of slavery from the land. The independence of Haiti reshaped the Atlantic world by leading to the French sale of Louisiana to the United States and the expansion of the Cuban sugar economy. Laurent Dubois weaves the stories of slaves, free people of African descent, wealthy whites, and French administrators into an unforgettable tale of insurrection, war, heroism, and victory. He establishes the Haitian Revolution as a foundational moment in the history of democracy and human rights.},

	abstract = {French colonial Louisiana has failed to occupy a place in the historic consciousness of the United States, perhaps owing to its short duration (1699-1762) and its standing outside the dominant narrative of the British colonies in North America. This anthology seeks to locate early Louisiana in its proper place, bringing together a broad range of scholarship that depicts a complex and vibrant sphere. Colonial Louisiana comprised the vast center of what would become the United States. It lay between Spanish, British, and French colonies in North America and the Caribbean, and between woodland and eastern plains Indians. As such, it provided a meeting place for Europeans, African, and native Americans, functioning as a crossroads between the New World and other worlds. While acknowledging colonial Louisiana's peripheral position in U.S. and Atlantic World history, this volume demonstrates that the colony stands at the thematic center of the shared narratives and historiographies of diverse places. Through its twelve essays, French Colonial Louisiana and the Atlantic World tells a whole story, the story of a place that belongs to the historic narrative of the Atlantic World.},

A sufficient number of migrants arrived from France and Africa to create settlements, establish economies of production, develop networks of exchange and trade, and adapt institutions of government and law to give substance and form to their resulting societies. Elusive Empire is the first full account of how during these years French settlers came to the Americas. It examines how they and thousands of African slaves together with Amerindians constructed settlements and produced and traded commodities for export. Bringing together much new evidence, the author explores how the newly constructed societies and new economies, without precedent in France, interacted with the growing international violence in the Atlantic world in order to present a fresh perspective of the multifarious French colonizing experience in the Americas.},

	abstract = {Have transnational currents (Atlantic, borderlands, continentalist) in the history of colonial North America overcome the distortions long associated with a national framing of research on the early modern period? Have we left behind the tendency to read the political geography of the nineteenth century back into the history of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries? Taking the example of writings on New France, a colonial formation that sprawled across large parts of what was to become Canada and the United States, this article argues that national historiographic traditions continue to exert a powerful influence. Even as they pursue their subject across modern borders, Canadian, Quebec and United States historians frequently view New France through the lens of their own respective national traditions. The recent upsurge of interest in New France on the part of Early Americanists is a welcome development, but its impact is somewhat vitiated by a tendency to retain a United States-centric intellectual agenda while annexing new territories and cultures to what remains a national intellectual enterprise. The article concludes with the suggestion that New France specialists situate their work more in a wider hemispheric context, one that includes comparative perspectives on Latin America and the Caribbean.

The central government, notably the Minist√®re de la Marine et des Colonies, systematically engaged the elaborate scientific infrastructure of Ancien-R√©gime France in its colonizing efforts, and French savants provided an essential expertise. This paper examines this bureaucratized scientific arm of France's contemporary "colonial machine" that included the Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences, the Acad√©mie Royale de Marine, the Observatoire Royal, the Jardin du Ro√≠, the Soci√©t√© Royale de M√©decine, the Soci√©t√© Royale d'Agriculture, and the Compagnie des Indes. These institutions and the individuals associated with them undertook coordinated efforts to support and extend contemporary French colonization. Their activities deal with tropical medicine, taxonomic and economic botany, cartography, and a host of related matters. With Paris and Versailles as the hub, by the end of the century an intricate web of institutions and expertise spanned the French colonial world from the Americas to the East Indies. Informal and unofficial colonial networks complemented the official administrative apparatus. The Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods witnessed the destruction of Ancien-R√©gime colonial structures--scientific and otherwise--yet, the lesson of the utility of science for the creation and maintenance of colonies was not lost on imperial planners who followed.},

It describes the main features of the political and historiographical context that inspired the writing of his book, The Age of the Democratic Revolution in the early 1950s (first volume published in 1959, second volume in 1964). It also argues that the war experience Palmer had in the historical section of the Army Ground Forces has been important in reviving the interest for the transatlantic dimension in modern history that was central in his PhD dissertation. This paper shows how the liberal-tocquevillian approach that Palmer adopted to explain the multiple revolutions that shook North America and Europe in the last quarter of the 18th century earned him the attacks of the Marxist historians. In its last part this paper makes use of private letters to claim that in the 1970s and 1980s the Italian historian Franco Venturi revived the scholarly interest in Palmer's perspective despite methodological differences between his Settecento riformatore and Palmer's analysis. Settecento riformatore and The Age of the Democratic Revolution have contributed to the interest in a transatlantic approach to 18th-century history that is now pursued under the heading of ‚Äúentangled histories‚Äù.},

It offers a working definition of the field and an account of its origins, development, and institutionalization from the 1970s until 2010. It briefly surveys the literature on several world regions, concentrating most heavily on South Asia and Latin America, where environmental history at present has grown especially lively. It considers the prominence of Americanists (that is, historians of the United States, not the same thing as Americans) in the field and how that prominence is now waning. It reviews the utility of environmental history for historians, sketches some of the critiques of environmental history, and comments upon some signal findings of recent years.},

Environmental stories are still more likely to turn up in introductions, sidebars, and footnotes to political, social, and economic histories than they are to be incorporated into those narratives in a transformative way, though we as environmental historians know that potential is there. As we struggle to identify what precisely it is that we want other historians to do with our work, we run up against questions of definition and mission: What is environmental history? What do we do that is unique? What do we want other historians to learn from what we do? Some scholars in our field have suggested that we can answer these questions by framing "environment" as a category of analysis parallel to race, class, and gender, arguing that careful attention to the environment offers as rich a way of uncovering power relationships in societies as attention to these other categories does. While it is true that power can be read in the environment, and is frequently expressed through it, I argue that "environment" as both concept and fact is so fundamentally different from class, race, and gender that the analogy does not work, and distracts us from another, more fruitful strategy for articulating the broader relevance of our scholarship: demonstrating the significance of material nature for histories beyond the environmental realm. If other historians would join us in our attention to the physical, biological, and ecological nature of dirt, water, air, trees, and animals (including humans), they would find themselves led to new questions and new answers about the past.},

It explores the ways in which post-constructivism has the potential to productively address many of the shortcomings of environmental history's theories and models that environmental historians themselves have begun to view with a critical eye. The post-constructivist authors discussed in this article, Donna Haraway and Bruno Latour, both represent challenges to the ways in which nature and the natural sciences tend to be conceptualized as non-problematized entities within environmental history. They also challenge the ways in which dichotomies of nature and culture tend to be reproduced within the program of environmental history. It is argued that these post-constructivist contributions represent a radical and arguably more truly historical way of introducing non-human actors into the historical narrative, and thus represent a potential reinvigoration of environmental history that would embrace a more radical historicity, greater diversity, and openness to difference.},

	abstract = {This essay sketches an expanded theoretical conception of the roles of nature and technology in history, one that is based on a social ontology that does not separate nature and society. History has long been viewed as the realm of past human action. On this conception, nature is treated largely as an Other of history, and technology is construed chiefly as a means for human fulfillment. There is no history of nature, and the history of technology becomes the history of useful products. The essay discusses the changes wrought in these understandings by a social ontology that depicts social existence as inherently transpiring in nexuses of practices and material arrangements. The first implication is that the domain of history should be expanded from the realm and course of past human activity to the realm and course of past practice-arrangement nexuses. In turn, this wider conception transforms the significance of nature and technology in history. Until recently, most accounts of the relationship between society/history and nature have presumed that society and history are separate from nature. On my account, by contrast, nature is part of society: a component of the practice-arrangement nexuses through which social life progresses. Human history, consequently, is a social-natural history that encompasses the varying presence and roles of nature in human coexistence. Technology, meanwhile, is not just useful products, and not just a mediator of society/history and nature. It also is (1) something through which humans manage social life and the nature that is part of it, largely by drawing nature into this site and thereby conjointly transforming society, technology, and nature in history; and (2) something that, over time, plays an increasingly central role in the nexuses where social life transpires. Through technology, in short, social-natural history takes form and advances.},

	abstract = {Consumption has emerged as an important historical subject, with most scholars explaining it as a vehicle for therapeutic regeneration, community formation, or economic policy. This work all but ignores how consumption begins with changes to the material world, to physical nature. While environmental historians have something important, even unique, to say about consumption, the split between materialist and cultural analyses within the field has dulled its ability to study consumption as a process and phenomenon that unfolds over space and time. By borrowing techniques from geography and ecology, environmental historians can analyze how space is socially produced through time, an insight that can help to connect material and cultural change in a sustained manner. Spatial histories can also unmask the relationships between production and consumption, and nature and culture, and thereby transcend and subvert seemingly fixed boundaries, from the local to the global. They can also further propel environmental historians into new realms of inquiry, such as international trade and the human body. Historicizing the spaces of consumption may also help to foster a more radical and democratic environmentalism, especially in developed nations, by compelling environmentalists to reassess the distancing effects of consumption upon their politics and attitudes toward those who produce commodities and consumer goods.},

	abstract = {This article is a meditation on the overlaps between environmentalism, post-colonial theory, and the practice of history. It takes as a case study the writings of the explorer-scientist-abolitionist Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859), the founder of a humane, socially conscious ecology. The post-colonial critique has provided a necessary corrective to the global environmental movement, by focusing it on enduring colonialist power dynamics, but at the same time it has crippled the field of environmental history, by dooming us to a model of the past in which all Euro-American elites, devoid of personal agency, are always already in an exploitative relationship with the people and natural resources of the developing world. A close reading of Humboldt's work, however, suggests that it could provide the basis for a healthy post-colonial environmentalism, if only post-colonial critics were willing to see beyond Humboldt's complicity in colonial structures. In particular, this article attempts to rehabilitate Humboldt's reputation in the face of Mary Louise Pratt's canonical post-colonial study, Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation. Humboldt's efforts to inspire communion with Nature while simultaneously recognizing Nature's "otherness" can be seen as radical both in his day and in ours. In addition his analysis of the link between the exploitation of natural resources and the exploitation of certain social groups anticipates the global environmental justice movement.},

	abstract = {AbstractAlthough prerevolutionary politicians worried about radicalized colonial readers, postrevolutionary historians often treated reading and printing as effects rather than as causes of the American Revolution. This essay reconsiders relations of print to politics by focusing on political reprinting and by examining the production and consumption of a cheap pamphlet of Locke's Second Treatise issued by Boston printers in 1773. Rather than asking if books make revolutions (or which books), scholars should balance the best-selling pamphlets against the worst, should consider the role of prerevolutionary tracts during and after Independence, and should attend more closely to the marketing of revolution.},

The article ends with an examination of The New England Primer, with a particular focus on changes to its content in the early republic. The print histories of these two publications reveal the fragmented nature of the British Atlantic world of print, and how this fragmentation continued to inform print in the new nation.},

Formerly spoken of and for by white masters, politicians, and ministers, early black writers utilized a variety of printed forms‚Äîfrom poetry to pamphlets‚Äîto claim their own voices in an emerging trans-Atlantic public sphere. Indeed, by connecting literary emancipation of black voices to the broader aims of abolitionism, early black writers made print media an integral part of racial reform movements well beyond the Age of Franklin.},

	isbn = {0195174879 (alk. paper) 9780195174878 (alk. paper)},
	abstract = {"The daughter of an Algonquin mother and an Iroquois father, Catherine/Kateri Tekakwitha (1656-1680) has become known over the centuries as a Catholic convert so holy that, almost immediately upon her death, she became the object of a cult. Today she is revered as a patron saint by Native Americans and the patroness of ecology and the environment by Catholics more generally, the first Native North American proposed for sainthood." "Tekakwitha was born at a time of cataclysmic change, as Native Americans of the northeast experienced the effects of European contact and colonization. A convert to Catholicism in the 1670s, she embarked on a physically and mentally grueling program of self-denial, aiming to capture the spiritual power of the newcomers from across the sea. Her story intersects with that of Claude Chauchetiere, a French Jesuit of mystical tendencies who came to America hoping to rescue savages from sin and paganism. But it was Claude himself who needed help to face down his own despair. He became convinced that Tekakwitha was a genuine saint and that conviction gave meaning to his life. Though she lived until just 24, Tekakwitha's severe penances and vivid visions were so pronounced that Chauchetiere wrote an elegiac hagiography shortly after her death." "With this study, Allan Greer has written a dual biography of Tekakwitha and Chauchetiere, unpacking their cultures in Native America and in France. He examines the missionary and conversion activities of the Jesuits in Canada, and explains the Indian religious practices that interweave with converts' Catholic practices. He also relates how Tekakwitha's legend spread through the hagiographies and to areas of the United States, Canada, Europe, and Mexico in the centuries since her death. The book also explores issues of body and soul, illness and healing, sexuality and celibacy, as revealed in the lives of a man and a woman, from profoundly different worlds, who met centuries ago in the remote Mohawk village of Kahnawake."--Jacket.},

	abstract = {Spaniards, Planters, and Slaves is a provocative look at the institution of slavery and its function as a part of Louisiana's culture during the years of Spanish rule. Gilbert C. Din challenges the idea that conditions under the Spaniards differed little from the years of French rule and examines how local culture merged with colonial government and residual laws to create a slave system unlike any other in the Deep South.Din presents many aspects of the slavery issue, including a look at the French system, conflicts between planters who favored the established system and governors who promoted the less stringent Spanish laws, and the political favoritism that sought to benefit the wealthy New Orleans district. Din also discusses the role of the Catholic Church.Using government documents from archives in Spain and Louisiana, Din paints a historically accurate portrait of a time when the blended culture of the eighteenth-century colony resulted in conflict and turmoil. Most important are the Papeles Procedentes de la Isla de Cuba, a collection of colonial documents that illustrate not only the actions but also the personalities of the governors and how they implemented changes and handled problems within the slave system.Spaniards, Planters, and Slaves is the first in its field to capture the years of Spanish rule as a specific and unique point in Louisiana's history of slavery. Din's research uncovers both the complexities of the slavery issue and the Spanish heritage that ultimately helped to shape the slave system of the future state. It is an ideal study for anyone interested in the history of both colonial Louisiana and slavery itself.},

	abstract = {Often hailed as an age of revolution, even of global crisis, the late eighteenth century was also an era when royal authority was acknowledged and subjecthood was affirmed. Subjects, as well as citizens, insisted on political, economic, and legal concessions and inserted their distinct voices into the annals of history through languages that expressed both deference and demands. Challenging scholarship that views subjects as inferior precursors to citizens, this dissertation argues that subjecthood served as an organizing and contested principle of the eighteenth century.
Focusing on the aftermath of the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), this project uncovers some of the rights that were eventually, though unevenly, associated with British subjecthood. During this period, questions about the status, duties, and rights of their multi-religious, multi-national, and multi-racial "new subjects" became increasingly pressing as British colonial officials sought to consolidate control over numerous conquered and ceded territories. The juxtaposition of case studies as disparate as Grenada, Quebec, Minorca, Gibraltar, and Calcutta highlights the importance of the language of subjecthood at the highest levels of imperial governance and in the daily lives of colonial subjects. Examining struggles over the meanings of subject status in each of these territories demonstrates how inhabitants and administrators wielded this language to secure political, economic, and legal privileges.
Ultimately, subjecthood both unified and divided a transformed British Empire. Individuals living across a variety of territories and under distinctive legal systems could lay claim to its protections. At the same time, since the rights of subjects remained relatively undefined by law, the privileges due subjects were variously interpreted and granted to greater or lesser extents across the colonies. The language of subjecthood was never merely formulaic, but rather, inhabitants actively and provocatively used it to make demands in response to local exigencies and opportunities. The story of subjecthood reveals an empire in which individuals constantly challenged the boundaries of belonging, inhabitants put forth claims that were different from those made within the realm, and authority was often negotiated more than it was imposed.},

	abstract = {This innovative work of historical sociology locates the origins of modern democratic discourse in the emergent culture of printing in early modern England. For David Zaret, the key to the rise of a democratic public sphere was the impact of this culture of printing on the secrecy and privilege that shrouded political decisions in seventeenth-century England. Zaret explores the unanticipated liberating effects of printing and printed communication in transforming the world of political secrecy into a culture of open discourse and eventually a politics of public opinion.Contrary to those who locate the origins of the public sphere in the philosophical tracts of the French Enlightenment, Zaret claims that it originated as a practical accomplishment, propelled by economic and technical aspects of printing--in particular heightened commercialism and increased capacity to produce texts. Zaret writes that this accomplishment gained impetus when competing elites--Royalists and Parliamentarians, Presbyterians and Independents--used printed material to reach the masses, whose leaders in turn invoked the authority of public opinion to lobby those elites.Zaret further shows how the earlier traditions of communication in England, from ballads and broadsides to inn and alehouse conversation, merged with the new culture of print to upset prevailing norms of secrecy and privilege. He points as well to the paradox for today's critics, who attribute the impoverishment of the public sphere to the very technological and economic forces that brought about the means of democratic discourse in the first place.},

	abstract = {The myth persists that in 1492 the Americas were a sparsely populated wilderness, "a world of barely perceptible human disturbance." There is substantial evidence, however, that the Native American landscape of the early sixteenth century was a humanized landscape almost everywhere. Populations were large. Forest composition had been modified, grasslands had been created, wild-life disrupted, and erosion was severe in places. Earthworks, roads, fields, and settlements were ubiquitous. With Indian depopulation in the wake of Old World disease, the environment recovered in many areas. A good argument can be made that the human presence was less visible in 1750 than it was in 1492.},

	abstract = {Based on a sweeping range of archival, visual, and material evidence, Wild Frenchmen and Frenchified Indians examines perceptions of Indians in French colonial Louisiana and demonstrates that material culture‚Äîespecially dress‚Äîwas central to the elaboration of discourses about race.At the heart of France's seventeenth-century plans for colonizing New France was a formal policy‚ÄîFrenchification. Intended to turn Indians into Catholic subjects of the king, it also carried with it the belief that Indians could become French through religion, language, and culture. This fluid and mutable conception of identity carried a risk: while Indians had the potential to become French, the French could themselves be transformed into Indians. French officials had effectively admitted defeat of their policy by the time Louisiana became a province of New France in 1682. But it was here, in Upper Louisiana, that proponents of French-Indian intermarriage finally claimed some success with Frenchification. For supporters, proof of the policy's success lay in the appearance and material possessions of Indian wives and daughters of Frenchmen.Through a sophisticated interdisciplinary approach to the material sources, Wild Frenchmen and Frenchified Indians offers a distinctive and original reading of the contours and chronology of racialization in early America. While focused on Louisiana, the methodological model offered in this innovative book shows that dress can take center stage in the investigation of colonial societies‚Äîfor the process of colonization was built on encounters mediated by appearance.},

	isbn = {978-0-87013-569-9},
	abstract = {The Sixty Years' War for the Great Lakescontains twenty essays concerning not only military and naval operations, but also the political, economic, social, and cultural interactions of individuals and groups during the struggle to control the great freshwater lakes and rivers between the Ohio Valley and the Canadian Shield. Contributing scholars represent a wide variety of disciplines and institutional affiliations from the United States, Canada, and Great Britain.Collectively, these important essays delineate the common thread, weaving together the series of wars for the North American heartland that stretched from 1754 to 1814. The war for the Great Lakes was not merely a sideshow in a broader, worldwide struggle for empire, independence, self-determination, and territory. Rather, it was a single war, a regional conflict waged to establish hegemony within the area, forcing interactions that divided the Great Lakes nationally and ethnically for the two centuries that followed.Among the varied topics are discussions of the impact of disease upon the Natives' military power and culture; the importance of the French familial and commercial interactions with the British and Indians; the emergence of intercultural cooperation in a region too often characterized as constantly at war; and the internal struggles by Native Americans to present a united front against European intrusion. Other scholars examine economic, political, and idealogical responses to the American Revolution; detailed accounts of military struggles, the Gnadenhutten massacre, and analyses of Indian and naval involvement in the War of 1812.},

	abstract = {The technique of social network analysis undergirds this exploration of how Frenchmen and Indian women created community through both marriage and godparenthood in the interracial community of Kaskaskia in the Illinois country. Previous scholars have shown the instrumental role that kinship and fictive kinship played in helping Frenchmen enter the Algonquian cultural habitus of the fur trade. But where these scholars focused on key individuals in fur trade communities, this essay uses all extant baptismal and marriage records to reconstruct the entire kinship network in one eighteenth-century bicultural village. The resulting analysis demonstrates that the most important actors in this social network were members of the most well-established agrarian households. Moving away from accepted wisdom about the instrumental functions of kinship within the fur trade, the essay instead suggests that kinship networks oriented Frenchmen, Indian women and their families toward an increasingly French, agrarian cultural habitus. While kinship remained important for constructing identities in Kaskaskia, just as in the larger world of the pays d'en haut fur trade, here kinship bonds functioned to assimilate Indian women as the bicultural trade world became increasingly agrarian, Catholic, and ‚ÄúFrench.‚Äù},

The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

Our review of recent evidence of Cahokian mortuary practices demonstrates that the Late Mississippian Kane Mound burial complex is very different from other contemporaneous burial sites. We argue that it represents the mortuary customs of a distinctive Cahokian subcommunity with ties to areas north and east of the American Bottom.},

A pedestrian survey and extensive excavations of 255 domestic buildings and related artifacts at 15 contemporaneous sites document a pattern of localized resettlement in which thousands of agricultural villagers moved or were displaced coeval with the founding of Cahokia. The resettled villagers appear to have moved into a previously unoccupied upland zone that surrounds the Mississippi River floodplain. Identified as the "Richland Complex," the seemingly abrupt resettlement corresponds to other regional evidence of demographic reconfiguration and cultural pluralism. The immediate effect of this study is a reorientation of research at Cahokia toward the goals of a "historical-processual" archaeology. /// En el proceso de construcci√≥n cultural los movimientos migratorios, el desplazamiento y el re-establecimiento de la poblaci√≥n en nuevos asentamientos son de gran importancia. Un estudio basado en recorridos de superficie y las minuciosas excavaciones de 255 edificios dom√©sticos y artefactos relacionados localizados en 15 lugares de la misma √© poca, documentan una pauta de re-establecimiento en la que miles de agricultores fueron desplazados en una epoca contempor√°nea a la fundaci√≥n de Cahokia.

In this research, we used a combination of X-ray diffraction, sequential acid dissolution, and inductively coupled plasma analyses to establish the source of the raw material used in the manufacture of the red figurines and pipes that epitomize the Cahokian-style. Our research demonstrates that these objects were made of locally available flint clays. This finding, in conjunction with other evidence, indicate Cahokian exploitation of many mineral and stone resources focuses on the northern Ozark Highlands to the exclusion of other areas.

	abstract = {During the early Mississippian Lohmann phase (A.D. 1050-1100), the American Bottom experienced a political and economic transformation. This transformation included the abrupt planned construction of central Cahokia, a large-scale influx of people to "downtown Cahokia," the abandonment of pre-Mississippian village settlements, the reorganization of farming in the Mississippi River floodplain, and the founding of the Richland farming complex in the Illinois uplands. New tree-ring-based records of climate change indicate that this rapid development occurred during one of the wettest 50-year periods during the last millennium. During the next 150 years, a series of persistent droughts occurred in the Cahokian area which may be related to the eventual abandonment of the American Bottom. By A.D. 1150, in the latter part of a severe 15-year drought, the Richland farming complex was mostly abandoned, eliminating an integral part of Cahokia's agricultural base. At about the same time, a 20,000-log palisade was erected around Monks Mound and the Grand Plaza, indicating increased social unrest. During this time, people began exiting Cahokia and, by the end of the Stirling phase (A.D. 1200), Cahokia's population had decreased by about 50 percent and by A.D. 1350, Cahokia and much of the central Mississippi valley had been abandoned. /// Durante la fase temprana del Lohmann Mississ√≠ppico (A.D. 1050-1100), el American Bottom se transform√≥ pol√≠tica y econ√≥micamente. Esta transformaci√≥n incluy√≥ la r√°pida planeaci√≥n de la construcci√≥n de Cahokia, una llegada masiva de gente al su centro, el abandono de los asentamientos de villas pre-Mississ√≠ppicas, la reorganizaci√≥n de la agricultura en las partes bajas del r√≠o Mississippi y la fundaci√≥n del complejo agr√≠cola Richland en la tierras altas de Illinois. Nuevos registros de cambio clim√°tico, basados en anillos de √°rboles, indican que este r√°pido desarrollo ocurri√≥ durante uno de los m√°s h√∫medos per√≠odos de 50 a√±os del √∫ltimo milenio. Durante los 150 a√±os siguientes, una serie de sequ√≠as persistentes ocurrieron en el √°rea de Cahokia, lo que debe relacionarse con el abandono del American Bottom. Para 1150 A.D., en la √∫ltima parte de una severa sequ√≠a de 15 a√±os, el complejo agr√≠cola Richland fue casi abandonado, eliminando una parte integral de la base agr√≠cola de Cahokia. Casi al mismo tiempo, una palizada de 20,000 estacas fue levantada alrededor de Monks Mound y la Grand Plaza, indicando el incremento de conflictos sociales. Durante este tiempo, la gente empez√≥ a salir de Cahokia y, para fines de la fase Stirling (1200 A.D.), la poblaci√≥n de Cahokia hab√≠a decrecido cerca del 50 por ciento; para 1350 A.D., Cahokia y gran parte del valle central del Mississippi hab√≠an sido abandonados.},

Recent research indicates important theoretical distinctions in the way in which archaeologists conceive of community, and further development of nontraditional theoretical models is necessary to improve our ability to understand communities of the past. This study offers a reconsideration of community that focuses on the incorporation of multiple spatial scales with social dynamics. Through the use of ethnographic and ethnohistoric examples, the link between community and spatial relationships in longhouse-using tribal societies is examined. A case study of community from the Oneota tradition of the North American midcontinent is then reconsidered using insights into kinds of community situated at and affecting multiple spatial scales. The reanalysis emphasizes the way human relationships in multiple social contexts created a multitude of spatially situated community links, and illustrates the importance of using alternative theoretical approaches.

	abstract = {Trade is a prominent activity across much of North America during the Late Prehistoric period. On the Southern Plains, two approaches are used commonly to explain trade during this period. In one, trade is part of a system of economic interdependence between egalitarian societies having very distinct subsistence strategies. In the other, trade reflects the incorporation of Plains societies into macroeconomies centered outside the Plains. I argue that these two approaches inadequately account for Plains trade and are too narrowly constructed to account for the wider trade of which the Plains is a part. As an alternative, I propose that trade develops on the Southern Plains and elsewhere as an internally motivated political activity within the context of widespread and increasing conflict accompanied by substantial spatial rearrangements of people.},

A primary thesis of this paper is that the Oneota life-way emerged from a Woodland base modified in the direction of the Mississippian pattern. The rapid appearance of a qualitatively distinctive pattern of socio-political organization, the multi-band or "tribal," is thought to be responsible in part for the difficulty in tracing this development. It is suggested that this level of integration became firmly established as the dominant socio-political structure throughout the northeastern United States by A.D. 1100-1200. Early Oneota settlements (A.D. 900-1300) are then contrasted to late Oneota settlements (A.D. 1300-1600) in Wisconsin and a difference in cultural ecological adaptation is suggested. Examples of organizational change in other cultures are briefly illustrated to suggest that the pattern of development may be at least in part recurrent.},

	abstract = {An extremely important institution among the Indians of the Southeast in the historic period, the calumet ceremony was first recognized by French adventurers in the Upper Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes region in the mid-seventeenth century. By the end of the century the ceremony was universal among Lower Mississippi Valley groups. A major focus of calumet literature in recent years has been on the timing of and the mechanism for the introduction of this ceremony in the Eastern Woodlands. Some have argued for prehistoric roots, while others have supported a historic development. A study of the spatiotemporal distribution of catlinite pipes is one way to address these issues, because such pipes are the principal archaeological expression of the ceremony. This paper focuses on the two most common catlinite pipe forms: disk pipes and elbow pipes. Overall, both forms are rare in the Southeast, but relatively they are widespread. The disk type has the greatest range and is also the earlier of the two forms, primarily being found during the protohistoric period. It is proposed here, however, that calumet introduction was coincident with the elbow catlinite form that first appeared in the Southeast in the mid-to-late seventeenth century. It is believed that calumet ceremonialism was spreading into the southern portion of the Lower Mississippi Valley at about the same time as the first French explorers were entering the area from the north.},

In truth, the mineralogy of each of the pipestones from those three geologic sources (provenances) are distinct from one another, and that of catlinite is diagnostic. Although most of the artifacts he evaluates are probably true catlinite, many of them might not be.

The Calumet Ceremony was a powerful ritual through which members of another tribe were adopted. It also promoted social unity within tribes and facilitated contact and trade between them. Perhaps the most detailed description of a Calumet Ceremony was recorded near the turn of the century by ethnographer Alice C. Fletcher. Fletcher witnessed the Hako, a version of the Calumet Ceremony practiced by the Chaui clan of the Pawnee. With the invaluable assistance of Tahirussawichi, a Pawnee Ku'rahus or ceremonial leader, and renowned Indian scholar James R. Murie, himself a Pawnee, the author describes in marvelous detail the intricate rhythm and structure of the ceremony. Each song of the Hako is transcribed, translated, interpreted by the Pawnee Ku'rahus, and later analyzed by the author. Fletcher concludes that the Hako promised longevity, fertility, and prosperity to individuals and worked to insure "friendship and peace" between clans and tribes. The Hako, originally published in 1904, is introduced by Helen Myers, an associate professor of music at Trinity College and the ethnomusicology editor of the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.},

	abstract = {Exogenous diseases represent one of the principal agents of culture change associated with the historic period, yet the timing of their initial influence remains undocumented in many regions of North America. Settlement variables, cooking pot volume, and mortality profiles from Oneota tradition occupations are used to investigate the possible occurrence of epidemics in the Upper Mississippi River valley. Synchronous fluctuations in settlement and ceramic variables indicate that following at least two centuries of population growth a significant population decline occurred in the early seventeenth century. Several factors provide support for the role of disease in this decline, including its timing, magnitude, and the documented presence of epidemics in adjacent regions combined with substantial evidence for extensive contact with those areas. This event, prior to direct, sustained contact, is associated with the increased intensity of intergroup exchange occurring with the fur trade. The ability to identify the occurrence of such epidemics is essential for understanding protohistoric cultural dynamics as well as the transmission of disease on a continental level. /// Las enfermedades ex√≥genas representan uno de los principales agentes de cambio cultural relacionados con una √©poca hist√≥rica, a√∫n queda por documentar la cronolog√≠a de su impacto inicial en muchas regiones de Norteam√©rica. Este estudio utiliza las variables de asentamiento, el volumen de las ollas de cocci√≥n, y datos de la mortalidad para investigar la posible ocurrencia de epidemias en la cultura Oneota del valle del Alto R√≠o Mississippi. Las fluctuaciones sincr√≥nicas de variables tanto en los asentamientos como en la cer√°mica indican que por lo menos despu√©s de dos siglos de aumento de poblaci√≥n, hubo una notable disminuci√≥n de la misma en la primera parte del siglo XVII. Hay varios factores que corroboran el papel de las enfermedades durante este per√≠odo de reducci√≥n de poblaci√≥n, incluyendo sus fechas de aparici√≥n, magnitud y evidencia documental sobre la presencia de epidemias en regiones adyacentes, junto con una abundante evidencia de contactos extensos con estas √°reas. Este fen√≥meno de disminuci√≥n, ocurrido antes del contacto directo y sostenido, se asocia con una mayor intensidad de intercambios entre grupos relacionados con el trueque de pieles. Identificar la ocurrencia de tales epidemias es fundamental para comprender tanto la din√°mica cultural protohist√≥rica como la transmisi√≥n de enfermedades por todo el continente.},

Skeletons with several forms of trauma, including arrow wounds, are often used as evidence of intergroup conflict, although opinion is divided over what these casualties might mean in terms of the effect of warfare on everyday life. Information on 191 patients from the nineteenth-century Indian Wars in the American West indicates that only about one in three arrows damaged bone, and as many as one-half of wounded lived for months or years following their injuries. Arrow wound distributions vary among Indian Wars cases, modern Papua New Guinea patients, and prehistoric skeletons from eastern North America, in large part because of differences in how fighting was conducted. Despite arguments to the contrary, it is reasonable to infer that even low percentages of archaeological skeletons with distinctive conflict-related bone damage indicate that warfare must have had a perceptible impact on ways of life. /// En a√±os recientes, el inter√©s de los arque√≥logos en Norte Am√©rica por la guerra prehist√≥rica se ha incrementado gradualmente, al igual que lo ha hecho en otras partes del mundo. Con frecuencia se utilizan esqueletos con diversas formas de trauma, incluyendo heridas de flecha, como evidencia de conflicto intergrupal, aunque se expresan distintas opiniones con respecto a lo que tales v√≠ctimas pueden representar en t√©rminos del efecto de la guerra en la vida diaria. Informaci√≥n procedente de 191 pacientes de las Guerras Indias del siglo XIX en el Oeste Americano, indica que s√≥lo una de tres flechas llegaba a da√±ar el hueso y que cerca de la mitad de los heridos sobreviv√≠a a sus lesiones.

Missouri's numerous vegetation zones and its diverse topography encompassed extreme variations, forcing prehistoric populations to seek a wide range of adaptations to the natural environment. As a result, Missouri's archaeological record is highly complex, and it has not been fully understood despite the vast amount of fieldwork that has been conducted within the state's borders. Michael J. O'Brien and W. Raymond Wood explore the array of artifacts that have been found in Missouri, pinpointing minute variations in form. They have documented the ranges in age and distribution of the individual forms, explaining why some persisted while others quickly disappeared. The book provides a comprehensive survey of what is currently known about Missouri's prehistoric peoples, often revealing how they made their living in an ever-changing world. The authors have applied rigorous standards of archaeological inquiry. Their main objective - demonstrating that the archaeological record of Missouri can be explained in scientific terms - is accomplished.},

This study first assesses those arguments using both the archaeological and historical records. The last part of the study discusses the implications of such arguments for Dhegihan material and nonmaterial culture. It is concluded that Dhegihan societies have proven hard to trace archaeologically because they were likely very late in arriving on the Plains. Dhegihan origins are more likely to lie in Oneota or the disintegration of Mississippian tradition societies.},

	abstract = {When Lewis and Clark and their command journeyed westward from St. Louis in 1804, they cemented that city's reputation as the "Gateway to the West" in the American imagination. But before this portion of the Mississippi drainage became an American gateway, it was a Native American crossroads. The confluence of the Illinois, Missouri, and Ohio rivers with the Mississippi River repeatedly made the region a frontier connecting Native American communities located throughout the interior of the continent. Since at least 9,000 B.C. Native Americans migrated, traded, and exchanged ideas, practices, and beliefs across this region. Native Americans also repeatedly settled in the region due to the variety of environmental boons provided by the rivers and their surrounding landscape. Thus a succession of Native American communities learned to navigate the possibilities and perils of living on a cross-cultural, multi-ethnic borderland prior to the arrival of Europeans. When Europeans first arrived in the Confluence Region they encountered Illinois peoples. The Illinois were recent newcomers drawn to this land by buffalo herds and interethnic relationships. Initially the Illinois sought to integrate the French into their set of frontier relationships, but they soon found that life on multiethnic frontier could be dynamically unstable. The same forces of geography and environment that had frequently drawn Native Americans to the Confluence Region drew large numbers of French settlers during the eighteenth century. Amid a growing colonial population, the Illinois found their value as both diplomatic and economic partners to the French eroding. Some Illinois incorporated themselves into the new colonial communities of the Confluence Region. Others abandoned the region to join other Indian communities less vulnerable to the colonial dominance. A few Illinois succeeded in maintaining an autonomous ethnic identity, but found to do so they had to remove themselves from the Confluence Region. By studying a succession of prehistoric and historic Native American communities in the Confluence Region, this dissertation demonstrates that prehistoric Native America was not a land and time without history. Native Americans had a meaningful past to draw upon as they faced a world changed by the arrival of Europeans and Africans.},

	abstract = {One or more of three intense and persistent droughts impacted some Native American cultures in the early-11th, middle-12th and late-13th centuries, including the Anasazi, Fremont, Lovelock, and Mississippian (Cahokian) prehistorical cultures. Tree-ring-based reconstructions of precipitation and temperature indicate that warm drought periods occurred between AD 990 and 1060, AD 1135 and 1170, and AD 1276 and 1297. These droughts occurred during minima in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and may have been associated with positive values of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Each of the Native American cultures was supported, to a greater or lesser degree, by precipitation-dependent resources. Both the Four Corners region and Cahokia were sites of intense growth between about AD 1050 and 1130, and by AD 1150, cultures in both regions were undergoing stress. By AD 1300 the Anasazi and Fremont cultures had collapsed and their residual populations had either left their homelands or withered. In the case of Fremont populations, the AD 990‚Äì1060 drought may have had the greatest impact. This drought also may have affected the Anasazi, for it was at the end of this drought that some people from Chaco migrated to the San Juan River valley and founded the Salmon Ruin great house. Detailed data do not exist on the number of Lovelock habitation sites or populations over time; however, Lovelock populations appear to have retreated from the western Great Basin to California by AD 1300 or shortly thereafter.},

In this essay I suggest that the Apple River and central Illinois River Mississippian chiefdoms exerted perhaps greater influence in their respective areas. This premise is based on a re-examination of existing data combined with new information from excavations of terminal Late Woodland and Langford tradition sites. The evidence implies that the Late Woodland‚ÄîUpper Mississippian transition is best understood as a continuous process involving social, political, and economic changes that I have labeled tribalization. Furthermore, it appears that this process was generated by, and was a direct reaction to, asymmetrical power relations. A contributing factor may have been the intensification of conflict between the indigenous Late Woodland-Upper Mississippian groups and the Mississippian chiefdoms.},

Oneota cultural organization is compared with Mississippian chiefdoms to the south for evidence of complexity. This approach does not extend the critique to a deep enough level, and the methods of dialectical materialism are introduced to analyze how value was created from social labor in the Oneota system. Oneota society is modeled as a tribal organization in which specific forms of social structures existed to justify production and differential distribution of a social-surplus. The organization of the Oneota production system engendered it to expand; therefore, the model is expanded to explain how symbolic motifs (hawks) developed as a standard of cultural hegemony for the Oneota. The transformation from Woodland to Oneota systems is analyzed as an historical process involving the reorganization of productive relations and the development of pan-ethnic symbols of dominance.},

Dale F. Lott, a distinguished behavioral ecologist who was born on the National Bison Range and has studied the buffalo for many years, relates what is known about this iconic animal's life in the wild and its troubled history with humans. Written with unusual grace and verve, "American Bison "takes us on a journey into the bison's past and shares a compelling vision for its future, offering along the way a valuable introduction to North American prairie ecology. We become Lott's companions in the field as he acquaints us with the social life and physiology of the bison, sharing stories about its impressive physical prowess and fascinating relationships. Describing the entire grassland community in which the bison live, he writes about the wolves, pronghorn, prairie dogs, grizzly bears, and other animals and plants, detailing the interdependent relationships among these inhabitants of a lost landscape. Lott also traces the long and dramatic relationship between the bison and Native Americans, and gives a surprising look at the history of the hide hunts that delivered the coup de gr ce to the already dwindling bison population in a few short years. This book gives us a peek at the rich and unique ways of life that evolved in the heart of America. Lott also dismantles many of the myths we have created about these ways of life, and about the bison in particular, to reveal the animal itself: ruminating, reproducing, and rutting in its full glory. His portrait of the bison ultimately becomes a plea to conserve its wildness and an eloquent meditation on the importance of the wild in our lives.},

	abstract = {Pollen diagrams from the Prairie Peninsula in Illinois record the climatically related vegetation shifts that have occurred since the late Pleistocene. They indicate that the major period of prairie development started between 8500 and 7900 BP, apparently occurring first along the southern margin. These events mark the beginning of the Hypsithermal interval and are correlated with the final disintegration of the Laurentide ice sheet and the establishment of the postglacial system of atmospheric circulation over North America. The late-glacial vegetation was spruce woodland in the north and open spruce woodland/tundra in central Illinois. These vegetation communities disappeared from the state in a northward direction between 14 000 and 10 900 BP. They were followed in northern Illinois by Pinus, Abies, Betula, and Fraxinus; in central Illinois Fraxinus expanded in the lowlands while the uplands remained relatively treeless. These assemblages, which persisted longer in the south than in the north, were subsequently replaced first by a mixture of cool temperate, then warm temperate deciduous trees as climatic amelioration continued. By 9000 BP, Illinois was dominated by deciduous forest. In response to Hypsithermal climatic stress, prairie vegetation began replacing deciduous forest about 8300 BP on the uplands in central Illinois and by 7900 BP xeric oak-hickory forest became dominant in northern Illinois. This is the beginning of the Prairie Peninsula as a discrete floristic area in Illinois. About 5000 BP the southern border of the Prairie Peninsula experienced increased moisture and renewed forest development suggesting a western contraction of the prairie margins. Central Illinois, however, remained grassland to the present. Between 900 and at least 400 yr ago an indicated trend toward cooler temperatures is correlated with late stages of the Neoglacial. Pollen evidence from northern Illinois and adjacent Lake Michigan indicates the reappearance or increase in Betula, Pinus, Picea and Larix. This short cool episode appears to end prior to the beginning of large-scale historic land clearance, about 140 yr ago, as the evidence for a vegetational readjustment to warmer climate is truncated by the logging of the forests, the plowing of the prairies and the resultant dramatic increase in Ambrosia pollen.},

	abstract = {No figure in the early American Republic is more notorious than James Wilkinson for his involvement in intrigue, conspiracy, and political double-dealing in frontier environs. Knowing Wilkinson‚Äôs mercenary motives and his long period as a paid Spanish agent, historians have tended to examine his myriad tactical maneuvers without sufficiently analyzing his geopolitical strategizing. This article offers an original perspective by exploring the process by which Wilkinson shifted his attention from the Kentucky-Mississippi borderlands to Hispanic-American revolution and the emergence of an independent Mexico. Wilkinson‚Äôs aspirations hinged on his capacity to exceed his countrymen in knowledge of the corridors of power linking the United States to the Spanish borderlands and Mexico. His passageways were variously routes of communication, trade, and possible military conflict. They were also avenues of contact with Spanish or Mexican elites‚Äîthose men who seemingly controlled the destinies of the frontier and the ways that land, mineral wealth, and other resources were to be developed. Wilkinson‚Äôs maneuverings exemplify major tendencies in Anglo-American geographic, political, and cultural imperialism from the late 1780s to the 1820s. Rather than being consistently tied to U.S. nationalistic expansion, Wilkinson‚Äôs exploits had a highly personal character in which individualistic adventurism shaped public purpose.},

Berdaches dressed in female clothing, assumed female occupations and restrictions, and pursued sexual relationships with both males and females. Eligible for status in a prestige system reserved for females, they then were ineligible for the advantages of status and power enjoyed by men. The Illinois neither honored nor despised berdaches. The tribespeople feared them because of the power they wielded as shamans and their acceptance as manitous. The Illinois reserved a special social position for the berdache, observed in ceremonial functions, which reflected the tribe's recognition of the berdache's special relationship to supernatural power. The institution of berdache disappeared after 1698.},

This collection of biographies, documenting the efforts of governors under French, British, Spanish, and American dominions, provides the background from which the modern state of Alabama has emerged. This volume contains, for the first time in any publication, photographs and portraits of sixty-five Alabama governors. The most comprehensive chapter focuses on George Wallace, three-time governor of the state and an influential force in national and presidential politics for many years. Author John Craig Stewart, novelist and historian, has written extensively on the subject. He is co-author of Know Alabama, a history text used in Alabama since 1957.

	shorttitle = {The {People} of the {River}'s {Mouth}},
	abstract = {The Missouria people were the first American Indians encountered by European explorers venturing up the Pekitanoui River‚Äîthe waterway we know as the Missouri. This Indian nation called itself the Nyut{\textasciicircum}achi, which translates to ‚ÄúPeople of the River Mouth,‚Äù and had been a dominant force in the Louisiana Territory of the pre-colonial era. When first described by the Europeans in 1673, they numbered in the thousands. But by 1804, when William Clark referred to them as ‚Äúonce the most powerful nation on the Missouri River,‚Äù fewer than 400 Missouria remained. The state and Missouri River are namesakes of these historic Indians, but little of the tribe‚Äôs history is known today. Michael Dickey tells the story of these indigenous Americans in The People of the River‚Äôs Mouth. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† From rare printed sources, scattered documents, and oral tradition, Dickey has gathered the most information about the Missouria and their interactions with French, Spanish, and early American settlers that has ever been published. The People of the River‚Äôs Mouth recalls their many contributions to history, such as assisting in the construction of Fort Orleans in the 1720s and the trading post of St. Louis in 1764. Many European explorers and travelers documented their interactions with the Missouria, and these accounts offer insight into the everyday lives of this Indian people. Dickey examines the Missouria‚Äôs unique cultural traditions through archaeological remnants and archival resources, investigating the forces that diminished the Missouria and led to their eventual removal to Oklahoma. Today, no full-blood Missouria Indians remain, but some members of the Otoe-Missouria community of Red Rock, Oklahoma, continue to identify their lineage as Missouria. The willingness of members of the Otoe-Missouria tribe to share their knowledge contributed to this book and allowed the origin and evolution of the Missouria tribe to be analyzed in depth. Accessible to general readers, this book recovers the lost history of an important people. The People of the River‚Äôs Mouth sheds light on an overlooked aspect of Missouri‚Äôs past and pieces together the history of these influential Native Americans in an engaging, readable volume.},

	abstract = {When Missiouri became the twenty-fourth state in the Union in 1821, it was already heir to a rich and varied historical legacy. From 1673 until the Louisiana Purchase, Europeans of different nationalities, assisted by the Africans they brought with them, competed alternately with Indians and among themselves for control of the land. But while land and resources were the target of the struggle, the region's cultural identity was being determined by the mingling and clashing of diverse cultures -- Indian, French, African, Spanish, and Anglo-American. The story of the blending of those diverse cultures in a land rich in resources and beauty is an extraordinary tale. Especially appealing to many readers will be the attention Foley gives to common Missourians, to the status of women and Blacks, and to Indian-White relations. In this account, the pioneer hunters, trappers, and traders who roamed the Ozark hills and the boatmen who traded on the Missouri and Mississippi rivers take their places beside the small coterie of prominent St. Louisans whose wealth and influence enabled them to dominate the region politically and economically. - Back cover.},

	abstract = {No assessment of the Plains Indians can be complete without some account of the Pawnees. They ranged from Nebraska to Mexico and, when not fighting among themselves, fought with almost every other Plains tribe at one time or another. Regarded as "aliens" by many other tribes, the Pawnees were distinctively different from most of their friends and enemies. George Hyde spent more than thirty years collecting materials for his history of the Pawnees. The story is both a rewarding and a painful one. The Pawnee culture was rich in social and religious development. But the Pawnees' highly developed political and religious organization was not a source of power in war, and their permanent villages and high standard of living made them inviting and 'fixed targets for their enemies. They fought and sometimes defeated larger tribes, even the Cheyennes and Sioux, and in one important battle sent an attacking party of Cheyennes home in humiliation after seizing the Cheyennes' sacred arrows. While many Pawnee heroes died fighting off enemy attacks on Loup Fork, still more died of smallpox, of neglect at the hands of the government, and of errors in the policies of Quaker agents. In many ways The Pawnee Indians is the best synthesis Hyde ever wrote. It looks far back into tribal history, assessing Pawnee oral history against anthropological evidence and examining military patterns and cultural characteristics. Hyde tells the story of the Pawnees objectively, reinforcing it with firsthand accounts gleaned from many sources, both Indian and white.},

This was an unusual contractual clause that was especially significant for the fact that Saguingouara was half-French and half-Indian, and had been brought up by an officer of noble origin legally married to an Indian woman convert. Saguingouara‚Äôs insistence on a laundry clause signaled his performance of European standards of cleanliness (premised on the act of changing into laundered linen rather than washing the body) rather than indigenous ones. This concept of cleanliness is also crucial for understanding how colonists apprehended indigenous bodies and how they rationalized differences in skin color.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, French, Spanish, and English traders vied for the tribe's favor and for permission to cross their lands. The Ioways fought in the French and Indian War in New York, the War of 1812, and the Civil War, but ultimately their influence waned as they slowly lost control of their sovereignty and territory. By the end of the nineteenth century, the Ioways were separated in reservations in Nebraska, Kansas, and Indian Territory. A new preface by the author carries the story to modern times and discusses the present status of and issues concerning the Oklahoma and the Kansas and Nebraska Ioways.},

	abstract = {"Deep River" offers a continental perspective on human bondage and emancipation in mainland North America. It unearths the deep history of indigenous and African slavery in the upper Mississippi River Valley and traces its connections outward toward the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. "Deep River" argues for a new spatial frame for the history of slavery and freedom to understand how colonial experiences in the upper Mississippi River Valley shaped the trajectory of emancipation in the United States. It also offers new perspectives on the history of emancipation by exposing free and enslaved black agency to eradicate slavery from Illinois. "Deep River" moves past legal categories as an organizing framework for slave and free societies. It demonstrates that inheritable bondage long survived its legal abolition. Displacing laws as the engine of change, it argues the collaborations between free black migrants, fugitive slaves, and white anti-slavery activists drove the processes of emancipation forward. Free and fugitive migrants into Illinois settled in black freedom villages which afforded slaves limited access to capital, avenues toward finding attorneys, and support in legal proceedings. In this way, Illinois's movement to a free society sprang from domestic migrations and a longer colonial legacy of trade and settlement in the Mississippi Valley, not laws and statutes passed by the United States. By focusing on the ways in which black northern migration and litigation in local courts shaped emancipation in the state, "Deep River" illuminates how legal and political development in Illinois followed the paths that enslaved African Americans created.},

	abstract = {French-Amerindian interaction in the Louisiana colony forced French people to define what French identity was and who could be included in it. Some colonists believed that non-Europeans were assimilable and could--if properly educated and Christianized--become "French" like them. Others believed that non-Europeans were inferior and could corrupt French civilization if not kept in their place. Although the racialist perspective eventually prevailed in mid-eighteenth-century Louisiana, the Louisiana colony represented the continuity of earlier French fantasies of assimilating Indians, as well as the deeper history of racist pseudoscience. The debate in Louisiana between Catholic assimilationists and racial essentialists presaged the later tension throughout the French empire between the French Revolution's republican universalism and nineteenth-century pseudoscientific racism. The race debate in eighteenth-century Louisiana illuminates the Old Regime origins of nineteenth- and twentieth-century French colonial ideology and the global influence of the French colonial experience in the Gulf South.},

	abstract = {The Illinois Indians are generally studied as a prominent group in the Illinois Country that continually became more dependent after increased European Influence. This study looked at the split within the Illinois Indians, particularly between the Kaskaskia and Peoria. The fracturing of the Illinois Indians was a prominent point in the decline of the group. Under European influence, many Kaskaskia became Christians and moved their village closer to the French. Alternatively, the Peoria challenged the Christian religion and remained in the Lake Peoria region. By using primary and secondary literature on the topic, the split between the Kaskaskia and Peoria was examined as one of main reasons as to why the Illinois Indians are seen as becoming more dependent after European contact. This study concludes that while many factors contributed to the decline of the Illinois Indians, such as disease, war, etc., the division between the Kaskaskia and Peoria needs to be included to the list of causes as to why the Illinois Indians lost their influence in the Illinois Country.},

	abstract = {Changes in Native American communities as they adapted to advancing Europeans. ¬† This volume investigates the use of deer, deerskins, and nonlocal goods in the period from A.D. 1400 to 1700 to gain a comprehensive understanding of historic-era cultural changes taking place within Native American communities in the southern Appalachian Highlands. In the 1600s, hunting deer to obtain hides for commercial trade evolved into a substantial economic enterprise for many Native Americans in the Middle Atlantic and Southeast.¬† An overseas market demand for animal hides and furs imported from the Americas, combined with the desire of infant New World colonies to find profitable export commodities, provided a new market for processed deerskins as well as new sources of valued nonlocal goods.¬† This new trade in deerskins created a reorganization of the priorities of native hunters that initiated changes in native trade networks, political alliances, gender relations, and cultural belief systems.¬†¬†  Through research on faunal remains and mortuary assemblages, Lapham tracks both the products Native Americans produced for colonial trade--deerskins and other furs--as well as those items received in exchange--European and native prestige goods that end up in burial contexts. Zooarchaeological analyses provide insights into subsistence practices, deer-hunting strategies, and deer-hide production activities, while an examination of mortuary practices contributes information on the use of the nonlocal goods acquired through trade in deerskins. This study reveals changes in economic organization and mortuary practices that provide new insights into how participation in the colonial deerskin trade initially altered Native American social relations and political systems.},

The eight papers presented at the ‚ÄúGrounded Histories‚Äù workshop turned instead toward smaller frameworks of study, pursuing histories focused not on space but on local and regional place, and demonstrating the power of place to convey complex meanings of identity and power, possession and belonging. Whereas the panoramic view of oceanic and global histories can sometimes discern large-scale connections not visible to historical subjects on the ground, the Dutch landskip perspective of grounded histories can perceive features of the historical landscape not discernible from a greater distance. Historians of early America, Halttunen argues, should not overlook those times and places when local attachments, vernacular knowledge, and a sense of grounded place proved more important to our subjects‚Äô experiences than transatlantic connections, imperial knowledge, and oceanic or global movement.},

To help understand why this shark targeted Pamperin and the more general question of why these animals sometimes attack humans, scientists created the Shark Attack File (SAF) to document as many historical and contemporary shark attacks as possible into legible data sets. To protect people from sharks, the SAF functioned as a model to help translate and predict sharks' behaviors but ultimately privileged environmental conditions and human vulnerability over the possibility of animal agency. Since 1959, many scholars in animal studies have tried to complicate earlier declensionist narratives that portrayed wild animals as passive entities into agents-in-the-world.},

	abstract = {New industrial machines and power sources, far from eliminating work animals from nineteenth-century America, required millions of horses to supply the energy necessary for industrial development. Horses were ubiquitous in cities and on farms, providing power for transportation, construction, manufacturing, and agriculture. Mechanization actually increased the need for horsepower by expanding the range of tasks requiring it. Ann Greene argues for recognition of horses' critical contribution to the history of American energy and the rise of American industrial power, and a new understanding of the reasons for their replacement as prime movers. Rather than a result of "inevitable" technological change, it was Americans' social and political choices about power consumption that sealed this animal's fate. The rise and fall of the workhorse was defined by the kinds of choices that Americans made and would continue to make--choices that emphasized individual mobility and autonomy, and assumed, above all, abundant energy resources.--From publisher description.},

As Americans of European extraction moved farther west, Morgan applied the trans-Appalachian speculation model in a unique manner and attempted to gain vast wealth and political power by obtaining rights to land west of the Mississippi River in Spanish Louisiana. In the end, his attempts to settle land and create a new society west of the Mississippi River extended, expedited, and facilitated the spread of Anglo-American settlements across the nation during the nineteenth century.},

	abstract = {Britain‚Äôs colonial empire in southeastern North America relied on the cultivation and maintenance of economic and political ties with the numerous powerful Indian confederacies of the region. Those ties in turn relied on British traders adapting to Indian ideas of landscape and power. In An Empire of Small Places, Robert Paulett examines this interaction over the course of the eighteenth century, drawing attention to the ways that conceptions of space competed, overlapped, and changed. He encourages us to understand the early American South as a landscape made by interactions among American Indians, European Americans, and enslaved African American laborers.Focusing especially on the Anglo-Creek-Chickasaw route that ran from the coast through Augusta to present-day Mississippi and Tennessee, Paulett finds that the deerskin trade produced a sense of spatial and human relationships that did not easily fit into Britain‚Äôs imperial ideas and thus forced the British to consciously articulate what made for a proper realm. He develops this argument in chapters about five specific kinds of places: the imagined spaces of British maps and the lived spaces of the Savannah River, the town of Augusta, traders‚Äô paths, and trading houses. In each case, the trade‚Äôs practical demands privileged Indian, African, and nonelite European attitudes toward place. After the Revolution, the new United States created a different model for the Southeast that sought to establish a new system of Indian-white relationships oriented around individual neighborhoods.},

She finds the seventeenth century a critical time in the development and articulation of racial ideologies‚Äîultimately in the idea of "hereditary heathenism," the notion that Africans and Indians were incapable of genuine Christian conversion. In Virginia in particular, English settlers initially believed that native people would quickly become Christian and would form a vibrant partnership with English people. After vicious Anglo-Indian violence dashed those hopes, English Virginians used Christian rituals like marriage and baptism to exclude first Indians and then Africans from the privileges enjoyed by English Christians‚Äîincluding freedom.Resistance to hereditary heathenism was not uncommon, however. Enslaved people and many Anglican ministers fought against planters‚Äô racial ideologies, setting the stage for Christian abolitionism in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Using court records, letters, and pamphlets, Goetz suggests new ways of approaching and understanding the deeply entwined relationship between Christianity and race in early America.},

	abstract = {This dissertation aims at exploring how political objects could be created during the Ancien R√©gime - whether qualified as French or Atlantic. By following the lines drawn by a specific colonial scandal, the Affaire de la Louisiane, it appears possible to discover the figure of the State, delineated by the often seamless transitions from narratives to physical oppositions, from the trivially material to the ethereally ideal.
Beginning with an interrogation on the nature of the sources which made such constructs possible, then as now, this dissertation then moves towards a study of the ways in which administrators of a French colony could define simultaneously the conditions of their obedience to the King's will, as well as their beliefs in a Common Good. These conditions could not, however, be divorced from the specific context of the Mississippi Valley. There, the old practices of the Company of the Indies left the King (or the State) in a position where it was felt required to intervene, albeit reluctantly, in the commercial realm. Through these aggregated actions which made the King a regulator, a trader, or a retailer, the State became an important issue of Louisiana's political life. Therefore, this dissertations nuances recent interpretations which purported to make a certain rejection of the State, an inherent characteristic of French Louisiana.
Louisiana's political life, as described, was one that could pretend to include few actors. Yet it required at the very least spectators, and nurtured in turn reflections upon the nature and exercise of authority. In so doing, the Affaire de la Louisiane necessarily asks the question of distance and similarities. By exploring the notion of interest as the driving force behind action, colonial administrators - and some ordinary colonial "thinkers" - could devise ways in which frontiers and limits could be drawn to a kind of authority which seemed, in the end, uncomfortably close to the pretensions of the French absolute monarchy.},

	abstract = {The living resources of California's rivers and coastal waters are among the most varied and productive in the world. They also offer a laboratory example of the mismanagement and waste that have attended the settlement and development of the North American continent. The Fisherman's Problem is a study of the interaction among resource ecology, economic enterprise, and law in the history of the California fishing industry. It analyzes the ways in which the natural environment not only provided the raw material for economic development but played an active role in it as well. As this book shows, the natural environment has a history both independent of, and yet influenced by, classic example of 'common property' re-environmental conservation generally, as well as in the management of the fisheries of the world's rivers and oceans. Professor McEvoy discusses the different ways in which human communities have harvested and managed the region's fisheries, from those of the American Indians and immigrants from Europe and Asia to those of modern, industrial-bureaucratic society. By reconstructing the ecological history of the fisheries during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this study develops a new perspective on environmental problems as contemporary observers understood them and on the results of their efforts to deal with those problems. The book concludes with an analysis of significant changes taking place in the 1970s and 1980s in the politics and theory of resource management. By combining a synthesis of recent scholarship in such disciplines as law, economics, marine biology, and anthropology with original research into the fishing industry's history, the book represents a significant new departure in the study of ecology and change in human society.},

Three ruminally and three bifistulated heifers were bred (pregnant/lactating; P/L; average calving date was February 11, 1989); remaining heifers served as controls (C). The experiment consisted of three periods (P1 = average of 55 d before parturition; P2 = average of 12 d before parturition; P3 = average of 26 d after parturition). All heifers grazed the same 24-ha Flint Hills range pasture. Dehydrated alfalfa pellets were supplemented at .5\% BW/heifer daily prepartum and at .8\% BW/heifer daily postpartum. Treatment x period interactions were noted (P less than .10) for forage OM intake, ruminal capacity, indigestible ADF (IADF) fill, and grazing time but not for OM digestibility or IADF passage rate (P greater than .10). In P1 and P3, P/L heifers had greater (P less than .10) forage OM intake than C heifers, whereas no differences were noted (P greater than .10) in P2. Pregnant/lactating heifers spent less time (P less than .10) grazing than did controls in P2 and more time (P less than .10) than controls in P3. Ruminal IADF fill and ruminal capacity, as measured by water fill, tended (P = .14 and .16, respectively) to differ between the two groups in P2. Digestibility of OM was unaffected (P greater than .10) by physiological status, whereas IADF passage rate was greater (P less than .10) in P/L heifers. Only minor differences were noted for the chemical composition of diets selected by the two groups. Ruminal fermentation patterns shifted only slightly; the largest effects were in P3, when P/L heifers had greater (P less than .10) propionate and less (P less than .10) acetate (mol/100 mol) than C heifers. In summary, during the period just before parturition, differences in forage OM intake between P/L and C heifers disappeared, and ruminal fill and capacity tended to be lower for P/L heifers. Intake was 16\% greater for P/L than for C heifers during the early postpartum period. Organic matter digestibility was not influenced by physiological status, even though IADF passage rates were greater for P/L heifers.},

In one experiment, richness declined on burned and fertilized treatments, whereas mowing maintained diversity under these conditions. In the second experiment, loss of species diversity due to frequent burning was reversed by bison, a keystone herbivore in North American grasslands.

	abstract = {* 1Management of rangelands has long operated under the paradigm of minimizing spatially discrete disturbances, often under the objective of reducing inherent heterogeneity within managed ecosystems. Management of grazing animals has focused on uniform distribution of disturbance, so that no areas are heavily disturbed or undisturbed (i.e. management to the ‚Äòmiddle‚Äô).
* 2A model of the fire‚Äìgrazing interaction argues that grazing and fire interact through a series of positive and negative feedbacks to cause a shifting mosaic of vegetation pattern across the landscape. This interaction was important in the evolution of species in the North American Great Plains grasslands. This approach has the potential to serve as an ecological-based model for management of grasslands with a long evolutionary history of grazing.
* 3We compared a heterogeneity-based approach, in which fire is applied to discrete patches, with typical homogeneity-based land management in the North American Great Plains, to determine if patch burning followed by focal grazing creates a shifting mosaic pattern of vegetation structure and composition.
* 4Our data suggest that spatially discrete fires promote focal grazing, where grazing animals devote 75\% of grazing time within the one-third of the area that has been burned within the past year. These focal disturbances cause local changes in the plant community and increase patch-level heterogeneity across landscapes. As the focal disturbance is shifted to other patches over time, successional processes lead to changes in local plant communities and the patchwork landscape can be described as a shifting mosaic.
* 5A patch-dynamic approach can be accomplished in the tallgrass prairie through applying spatially discrete fires and allowing animals free access to a diversity of landscape elements that vary in time since focal disturbance. This increases heterogeneity across the landscape, a variable that has been shown to be critical to some wildlife species as well as the structure and function of grassland ecosystems.
* 6Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that the fire-grazing model may be useful for generating heterogeneity in grassland management. Discrete fires are applied to patches, and patchy grazing by herbivores promotes a shifting vegetation mosaic across the landscape. Furthermore, application of the model has the potential of increasing the area of rangelands under management for conservation purposes, because livestock production is maintained at a level similar to traditional management. So, by managing transient focal patches that move through the landscape, heterogeneity has the potential to be a central paradigm for managing landscapes for multiple objectives, such as biodiversity and agricultural productivity.},

Furthermore, all three types of heterogeneity interact and can either reinforce or offset one another, thereby affecting system stability and dynamics.

In 1776, Thomas Paine published Common Sense, the Continental Congress declared independence, and Washington crossed the Delaware. We are familiar with these famous moments in American history, but we know little about the extraordinary events occurring that same year far beyond the British colonies. In this distinctive history, Claudio Saunt tells an intriguing, largely untold story of an immense and restless continent connected in surprising ways. In that pivotal year, the Spanish established the first European colony in San Francisco and set off a cataclysm for the region‚Äôs native residents. The Russians pushed into Alaska in search of valuable sea otters, devastating local Aleut communities. And the British extended their fur trade from Hudson Bay deep into the continent, sparking an environmental revolution that transformed America‚Äôs boreal forests. While imperial officials in distant Europe maneuvered to control lands they knew almost nothing about, America's indigenous peoples sought their own advantage. Creek Indians navigated the Caribbean to explore trade with Cuba. The Osages expanded their dominion west of the Mississippi River, overwhelming the small Spanish outposts in the area. And the Sioux advanced across the Dakotas. One traditional Sioux history states that they first seized the Black Hills, the territory they now consider their sacred homeland, in 1776. "Two nations were born that year," Saunt writes. The native one would win its final military victory at the Battle of Little Bighorn one hundred years later. From the Aleutian Islands to the Gulf Coast and across the oceans to Europe‚Äôs imperial capitals, Saunt‚Äôs masterfully researched narrative reveals an interconnected web of history that spans not just the forgotten parts of North America but the entire globe. Richly illustrated, with maps that reenvision a familiar landscape, West of the Revolution explores a turbulent continent in a year of many revolutions. 22 illlustrations, 15 maps},

Hudson focuses particularly on the creation and mapping of boundaries between Creek Indian lands and the states that grew up around them; the development of roads, canals, and other internal improvements within these territories; and the ways that Indians, settlers, and slaves understood, contested, and collaborated on these boundaries and transit networks.While she chronicles the experiences of these travelers--Native, newcomer, free, and enslaved--who encountered one another on the roads of Creek country, Hudson also places indigenous perspectives squarely at the center of southern history, shedding new light on the contingent emergence of the American South.},

Ecotones, being defined as zones of transition between adjacent ecological systems, also must occur over an equally broad spectrum of space and time scales. Scale-dependent constraints influence ecological phenomena and resulting zones of transition; however, in traditional ecotone studies little treatment has been given to these influences. This paper addresses aspects of the ecotone concept that relate to the strength of interactions between adjacent systems for a hierarchy of ecotones in a biome transition area in central New Mexico on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. Zones of transition occur at plant, population, patch, landscape, and biome levels in the hierarchy suggested here. Constraints differ across this hierarchy, primarily because of the different scales at which these constraints exert their influences. The basic strategy to understand these cross-scale influences must be to perform studies at different scales, and a hierarchical approach identifies those scales. This also is important for identifying the appropriate technologies that focus at the scales where transition zones between ecological systems/phenomena are expressed. A broad array of technologies are available for integrating the pattern--process relationships that occur across the many scales in ecological systems.},

The present paper attempts to develop quantitative methods for mapping farming-pastoral ecotones in China. Nine indicators, related to temperature, precipitation and altitude aspects, were selected to quantify ecological susceptibility of vegetation (crops and forage). Methods of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and expert score ranking combined with fuzzy set theory were applied to assign the weight for each indicator and to define the membership functions. The geographic information system (GIS) was used to manage the spatial database and conduct the spatial analysis. According to the spatial calculation of evaluation model integrated with GIS, the ecological susceptibility of vegetation (crops and forage) was mapped. Three different zones, pastoral area, farming-pastoral ecotones and farming area, were classified by spatial cluster analysis and the maximum likelihood classification for the numeric map of vegetation ecological susceptibility by GIS. This map was validated by the economic statistical result based on the ratio of the output value from animal husbandry in total output value of agriculture by the National Bureau of Statistics in China, indicating that the mapping of the farming-pastoral ecotones may be accepted.},

	abstract = {The prairie-forest transition in midcontinental North America is a major physiognomic boundary, and its shifts during the Holocene are a classic example of climate-driven ecotonal dynamics. Recent work suggests asymmetrical Holocene behavior, with a relatively rapid early Holocene deforestation and more gradual reforestation later in the Holocene. This paper presents a new synthesis of the Holocene history of the Great Plains prairie-forest ecotone in the north-central US and central Canada that updates prior mapping efforts and systematically assesses rates of change. Changes in percent woody cover (\%WC) are inferred from fossil pollen records, using the modern analog technique and surface-sediment pollen samples cross-referenced against remotely sensed observations. For contemporary pollen samples from the Great Plains, \%WC linearly correlates to percent arboreal pollen (\%AP), but regression parameters vary interregionally. At present, \%AP is consistently higher than \%WC, because of high background levels of arboreal pollen. Holocene maps of the eastern prairie-forest ecotone agree with prior maps, showing a rapid decrease in \%WC and eastward prairie advance between 10,000 and 8000¬†ka (1¬†ka = 1000 calibrated years before present), a maximum eastward position of the ecotone from 7 to 6¬†ka, and increased \%WC and westward prairie retreat after 6¬†ka. Ecotone position is ambiguous in Iowa and southeastern Minnesota, due to a scarcity of modern analogs for early-Holocene samples with high Ulmus abundances and for samples from alluvial sediments. The northern prairie-forest ecotone was positioned in central Saskatchewan between 12 and 10¬†ka, stabilized from 10 to 6¬†ka despite decreases in \%WC at some sites, then moved south after 6¬†ka. In both east and north, ecotonal movements are consistent with a dry early Holocene and increasing moisture availability after 6¬†ka. Sites near the ecotone consistently show an asymmetric pattern of abrupt early Holocene deforestation (\&lt; 300¬†years) and gradual reforestation after 6¬†ka. Early Holocene decreases in \%WC are faster than the corresponding drops in \%AP, because the analog-based \%WC reconstructions correct for the high background levels of arboreal pollen types that blur temporal variations in \%AP. For example, at Elk Lake, the \%AP decline lasts 1000¬†years, whereas the \%WC decline occurs between adjacent pollen samples, approximately 300¬†years apart. Thus, early Holocene deforestation may have been even more abrupt than previously recognized. Rapid deforestation likely was promoted both by rapid climate changes around 8.2¬†ka and positive fire-vegetation feedbacks. Non-linear vegetational responses to hydrological variability are consistent with 1) other paleorecords showing rapid die-offs of some eastern tree species in response to aridity and 2) observations of threshold-type ecological responses to recent climate events. The 21st-century trajectory for the Great Plains prairie-forest ecotone is uncertain, because climate models differ over the direction of regional precipitation trends, but future drying would be more likely to trigger threshold-type shifts in ecotone position.},

Arguments about the "predictability" of herd movements are particularly weakened by this problem. Modern ecological research indicates that there are two critical factors which need to be addressed in reconstructing bison ecology on the Plains: the pattern of forage and other conditions which structure bison adaptations to a given local environment, and the effect of white expansion and predation upon these adaptations. This paper discusses several important aspects of the relationship between environmental conditions and bison ecology and presents information suggesting that historical records document a period during which bison adaptations were being seriously disrupted. Direct extrapolations from historic to prehistoric times which rely on these records are therefore uncertain.},

	abstract = {Prehistoric human seasonal movements on the northern Great Plains frequently are explained in relation to postulated bison movement patterns. Two contradictory hypotheses regarding seasonality of bison movements have emerged in the archaeological literature, with consequent implications for explanations of human demographic relationships. One postulate is that bison herds migrated regularly between woodland and grassland environments with the seasons. The opposing postulate is that bison did not migrate, engaging in no more than erratic seasonal movements. Based on recorded historical observations and recent scientific data, these interpretations have had a powerful influence on explanations of prehistoric human movement and settlement patterns, at times leading to active debate. Recent ecological evidence indicates that a common foraging strategy among bovines employs a dual dispersion practice ‚Äî some populations migrate to grasslands seasonally while others remain sedentary in wooded, ecologically varied locations. In other words, migratory and non-migratory behavior occur at the same time among herds which share the wooded ecosystems. Historical and ecological data suggest that the bison of the northern Great Plains employed such dual dispersion behavior, utilizing ecological niche opportunities. A human demographic implication of this ecological observation favors a model of human bands often seeking partially wooded, ecologically varied locations for habitation, venturing into open grasslands seasonally when the migrating herds were there. These wooded habitats also were those preferred by the more predictable, less migratory bison herds. These habitats also supplied other important resources such as wood, vegetable foods, deer and smaller game.},

	abstract = {[English] Recent research on the Inka has documented the strategies and effects of imperial administration at a provincial and household level. Less is known, however, about the structure and dynamics of the Inka frontier and its impact on local and economic processes. The southeastern Inka frontier-according to ethnohistoric record-was the setting for conflict between the Inkas and the Guaran√≠-speaking Chiriguano groups from the Chaco piedmonts and Amazonian lowlands. In the context of two competing frontier models, one military (a hardened perimeter or in-depth defense) and one cultural (with wide socioeconomic processes), this article evaluates the nature of the southeastern Inka frontier and its effects on local socioeconomic dynamics. Archaeological and ethnohistorical research at Oroncota and Cuzcotuyo, two Inka centers of this frontier, suggest an alternative in the form of a "soft military frontier" formed by outposts and imperial centers disembedded from local socioeconomic processes. While architecture reveals high levels of investment, settlement data, storage capability, and the distribution of Inka imperial materials all suggest a minimal involvement in local socioeconomic processes. The results are relevant to understanding Inka frontier strategies and provide a case study of frontier interaction between a highly organized prehistoric state and tribal populations. // [Spanish] Recientes investigaciones han documentado las estrategias y efectos de la administraci√≥n Inka imperial a niveles provinciales y dom√©sticos.

But while this radical restructuring destroyed certain aspects of indigenous society, Jeremy Ravi Mumford's Vertical Empire reveals the ways that it preserved others. The campaign drew on colonial ethnographic inquiries into indigenous culture and strengthened the place of native lords in colonial society.

In striking counterpoint to these analyses, Lisa Brooks demonstrates the ways in which Native leaders‚Äîincluding Samson Occom, Joseph Brant, Hendrick Aupaumut, and William Apess‚Äîadopted writing as a tool to reclaim rights and land in the Native networks of what is now the northeastern United States. ¬†‚ÄúThe Common Pot,‚Äù a metaphor that appears in Native writings during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, embodies land, community, and the shared space of sustenance among relations. Far from being corrupted by forms of writing introduced by European colonizers, Brooks contends, Native people frequently rejected the roles intended for them by their missionary teachers and used the skills they acquired to compose petitions, political tracts, and speeches; to record community councils and histories; and most important, to imagine collectively the routes through which the Common Pot could survive. Reframing the historical landscape of the region, Brooks constructs a provocative new picture of Native space before and after colonization. By recovering and reexamining Algonquian and Iroquoian texts, she shows that writing was not a foreign technology but rather a crucial weapon in the Native Americans‚Äô arsenal as they resisted‚Äîand today continue to oppose‚Äîcolonial domination.},

And they carried resources and knowledge that shaped world civilization--from chocolate, tobacco, and potatoes to terrace farming and suspension bridges. Weaver makes clear that indigenous travelers were cosmopolitan agents of international change whose engagement with other societies gave them the tools to advocate for their own sovereignty even as it was challenged by colonialism.},

	abstract = {A well-known facet of ecosystems is that the edges--the boundaries or transitions from one ecosystem to another--often exhibit high levels of species richness or biodiversity. These transitional areas often show features of species composition, structure, and function representative of the ecosystems they transcend, as well as having their own unique array of species and characteristics. Cultural transitional areas--zones where two or more cultures converge and interact--are similarly rich and diverse in cultural traits, exhibiting cultural and linguistic features of each of the contributing peoples. This results in an increase in cultural capital, and resilience, by providing a wider range of traditional ecological knowledge and wisdom on which to draw, especially in times of stress and change. We propose that indigenous peoples whose living territories traverse ecological edges have a correspondingly increased access to economically important resources and therefore have a greater capacity for flexibility. Finally, we suggest that indigenous peoples are drawn to areas having a high incidence of ecological edges, and furthermore, that they actively create and maintain ecological edges. This practice provides them with a greater diversity of cultural capital and helps to maintain their flexibility and resilience. Examples from several regions of Canada are provided, from the southern interior of British Columbia, to the Lake Winnipeg watershed of Manitoba and Ontario, to James Bay.},

	doi = {10.2307/3565577},
	abstract = {We develop a conceptual foundation for the investigation of ecosystem patterns and processes that explicitly considers the spatial patchiness of ecological landscapes. Our emphasis is on "boundary dynamics" - the factors determining the location of boundaries between patch types in a landscape mosaic, how boundaries affect ecological processes and the movement of materials over an area, and how imbalances in these transfers in space can affect boundary characteristics and landscape configuration. We suggest that, other things being equal, the edaphic patterns of a landscape will determine the spatial patterning of the biota in the system, primarily through their effects on vegetation. Boundaries in a landscape may be located as direct consequences of the edaphic pattern, or may reflect perturbations of this underlying pattern due to physical disturbances or the actions of various transfer agents or "vectors." Abiotic vectors such as wind or surface water flow respond differently to boundary features than do biotic vectors such as beetles or rodents. Both abiotic and biotic vectors may create disturbances through their actions, which in turn may alter patch boundary locations. Vectors also contribute directly to movements of materials, energy, or organisms over the landscape, both within and between patches, and thereby may determine the spatial patterns of the spread of perturbations through the system. If there are net imbalances in fluxes or the spread of disturbances across boundaries in relation to within-patch processes, a directional bias to system fluxes will be established. Over time, this changes the characteristics and locations of patch boundaries. Boundaries thus have dynamics that are superimposed on the edaphic foundation. Consideration of these dynamics offers the potential to gain insight into the spatial configuration of ecosystem functioning and emphasizes the value of a reductionist approach to ecosystem studies. /// –ú—ã –ø—Ä–æ–≤–æ–¥–∏–º –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ–ø—Ç—É–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –æ–±–æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π —Ç–∏–ø–æ–≤ —ç–∫–æ—Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º –∏ –ø—Ä–æ-—Ü–µ—Å—Å–æ–≤, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ —á–µ—Ç–∫–æ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—É—é –º–æ–∑–∞–∏—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å —ç–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏-—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ª–∞–Ω–¥—à–∞—Ñ—Ç–æ–≤. –û—Å–æ–±–æ–µ –≤–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏–µ —É–¥–∞–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è "–¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏–∫–µ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü" - —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª—è—é—â–∏–º –ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü –º–µ–∂–¥—É —Ç–∏–ø–∞–º —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–æ–≤ –≤ –ª–∞–Ω–¥—à–∞—Ñ—Ç–Ω–æ–π –º–æ–∑–∞–∏–∫–µ, –∫–∞–∫ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –≤–ª–∏—è—é—Ç –Ω–∞ —ç–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø–æ—Ü–µ—Å–æ—ã –∏ –Ω–∞ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–º–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤–µ—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –≤ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ, –∏ –∫–∞–∫ –¥–∏—Å–±–∞–ª–∞–Ω—á —ç—Ç–∏—Ö –ø–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–æ—Å–æ–≤ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –≤–ª–∏—è—Ç—å –Ω–∞ —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏-–∫–∏ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü –∏ –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–∏—Ç—É—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—é –ª–∞–Ω–¥—à–∞—Ñ—Ç–∞. –ú—ã –ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞–µ–º, —á—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏—Ö —Ä–∞–≤–Ω—ã—Ö —É-—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è—Ö, —ç–¥–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ª–∞–Ω–¥—à–∞—Ñ—Ç–∞ –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª—è—Ç—å –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ç-–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –±–∏–æ—Ç—ã –≤ —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–µ, –ø—Ä–µ–∂–¥–µ –≤—Å–µ–≥–æ, –ø—É—Ç–µ–º –≤–ª–∏—è–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏-—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å. –ì—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –≤ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ö –ª–∞–Ω–¥—à–∞—Ñ—Ç–∞ –º–æ–≥—É—Ç –±—ã—Ç—å –ª–æ–∫–∞–ª–∏–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω—ã –∫–∞–∫ –ø—Ä—è–º–æ–µ —Å–ª–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ —ç–¥–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —É—á–ª–æ–≤–∏–π, –ª–∏–±–æ –º–æ–≥—É—Ç –æ—Ç—Ä–∞–∂–∞—Ç—å –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è —ç—Ç–∏—Ö —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏–π –≤—Å–ª–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ —Ñ–∏–∑–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –Ω–∞—Ä—É—à–µ–Ω–∏–π –∏–ª–∏ –≤–æ–∑–¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã—Ö –∞–≥–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–≤ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–º—â–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏–ª–∏ "–≤–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≤". –ê–±–∏–æ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä—ã, —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –∫–∞–∫ –≤–µ—Ç–µ—Ä –∏–ª–∏ –ø–æ–≤–µ—Ä—Ö–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–π —Å—Ç–æ–∫ –≤–æ–¥—ã –ø–æ-—Ä–∞–∑–º–æ–º—É –≤–ª–∏—è—é—Ç –Ω–∞ —Å–≤–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü, –Ω–µ–∂–µ–ª–∏ –±–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä—ã, —Ç–∞–∫–∏–µ –∫–∞–∫ –∂—É–∫–∏ –∏–ª–∏ –≥—Ä—ã–∑—É–Ω—É. –ê–±–∏–æ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –∏–ª–∏ –±–∏–æ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä—ã –º–æ–≥—É—Ç –≤—ã-–∑—ã–≤–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞—Ä—É—à–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å–≤–æ–∏–º–∏ –≤–æ–∑–¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è–º–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –≤ —Å–≤–æ—é –æ—á–µ—Ä–µ–¥—å, –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω—è—é—Ç –ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–æ–≤. –í–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä—ã —Ç–∞—é–∂–µ –ø—Ä—è–º–æ –≤–ª–∏—è—é—Ç –Ω–∞ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–æ—Å –≤–µ—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞, —ç–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–∏–∏ –∏–ª–∏ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–º–æ–≤ –≤ –ª–∞–Ω–¥—à–∞—Ñ—Ç–∞—Ö, –≤ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ö —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–æ–≤ –∏–ª–∏ –º–µ–∂–¥—É –Ω–∏–º–∏ –∏ —Ç–∞–∫–∏–º –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–º –º–æ–≥—É—Ç –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª—è—Ç—å —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π –ø–µ—Ä—Ç—É–±–∞—Ü–∏–π –≤ —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–µ. –ï—Å–ª–∏ —ç—Ç–æ - —á–∏—Å—Ç—ã–µ —Ä–∞–∑–±–∞–ª–∞–Ω—Å—ã –ø–æ—Ç–æ–∫–æ–≤ –∏–ª–∏ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç-—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–µ—Ä—Ç—É—Ä–±–∞—Ü–∏–π –∑–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª—ã –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü –≤ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Å—Å–æ–≤, –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–µ–∫–∞—é—â–∏—Ö –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–∏ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–∞, –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–∞ –∏–º–µ—Ç—å –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è —Ç–µ–Ω–¥–µ–Ω—Ü–∏—è –≤ —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–µ –ø–æ—Ç–æ-–∫–æ–≤. –°–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–µ–º —ç—Ç–æ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω—è–µ—Ç —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∏ –∏ –ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–æ–∑. –ì—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü—ã, —Ç–∞–∫–∏–º –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–º, –∏–º–µ—é—Ç –¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏–∫—É, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è –Ω–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞ —ç–¥–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å-–∫—É—é –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤—É. –ê–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑ —ç—Ç–æ–π –¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏–∫–∏ –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏—è –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω-—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–∏–≥—É—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ —Ñ—É–Ω–∫—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∏—Ä—É—é—à–µ–π —ç–∫–æ—Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ã –∏ –ø–æ–¥—á–µ—Ä–∫–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ä–µ–¥—É–∫—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ–¥—Ö–æ–¥–∞ –∫ –∏–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—é —ç–∫–æ—Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ã.},

	abstract = {Abstract In 1818, following Napoleon's fall and the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France, a band of French veterans exiled in the United States established Champ d'Asile [‚ÄúField of Asylum‚Äù], a short-lived colony on the edge of Spanish Texas. Led by General Charle Lallemand, the settlers intrigued observers around the Atlantic and inspired a romantic, indeed utopian, mythology celebrating them as soldat-laboureurs [‚Äúfarming soldiers‚Äù]. The adventure proved to be a social experiment through which the Napoleonic veterans embraced collectivist, egalitarian, and anti-capitalist ideas and practices as they redefined their own political identity. Marooned on the Texas frontier, they lived and labored alongside Native Americans and African Americans, on whom their survival depended. This essay argues that the international origins and experience of these Napoleonic veterans, and their association with Jean Laffite's ragtag band of freebooters, made them ‚Äúa motley collection of all nations‚Äù ‚Äì practical cosmopolitans, or citizens of the world, who challenged the limits of national allegiance. Their engagement with liberty and equality, race and slavery, and citizenship and cosmopolitanism in the south-western borderlands of North America generated an explosion of documents in French, Spanish, and English, which illuminate the French Atlantic in the Age of Revolution.},

	abstract = {Abstract This introductory essay explores recent shifts in perspective in the study of the French and francophone Atlantic world. It takes as a touchstone changes in the place of Louisiana and the French colonial period in American history and consciousness. The essay traces the evolution of both anglophone and francophone Atlantic historiography, elucidating the shift in meanings attributed to the relationship between France and its Atlantic colonies. It then explores the recent emergence of alternative interpretations grounded in a vision of a decentered Atlantic theater where local actors, locations, vectors and networks of power, knowledge, and resources interact with each other and with the metropolitan center. It suggests that this reframing has led to a renewed appreciation for earlier primary and secondary French colonial history writing which can now be seen as central texts for understanding Europe during the emergence of modernity. A similar transformation is traced in the localized histories of former French Atlantic colonies, from Quebec and West Africa to Haiti, and then continued in the emergence of new research efforts ‚Äì concentrated in centers of French colonial influence and especially France's port cities ‚Äì based on a direct confrontation with the role of the slave trade and the complex forms of exchange behind it. A discussion of recent approaches to French Atlantic science highlights the networks of actors and political and economic power that were often implicated in the establishment of matters of fact in the Atlantic colonial theater. The contrasting experiences of Jesuit, Franciscan, and Huguenot colonials point to a newly complex understanding of the New World religious and missionary experience. The essay then explores some of the ways that recent Atlantic scholarship has influenced the practice of French history, casting new light on such traditional topics as the Wars of Religion, education, and the Enlightenment. After brief summaries of the issue's articles, the essay then suggests that through this new understanding of the complex interaction of natives and colonizers, local, European, and native world views and alliance structures, and of indigenous and metropolitan knowledge and power, a coherent historical image of a francophone Atlantic world finally emerges.},

	abstract = {Abstract Using the lens of an engraving of indigenous deer hunters in sixteenth-century Florida, this essay explores the formation of a resistant Protestant identity through the French Huguenot attempt to colonize Florida between 1562 and 1565. The French approached the Timucuan people indigenous to that region of Florida through a diplomatic strategy of friendship, hoping to win their allegiance against the Spanish and in favor of the reformed religion. Though their intention was to offer a more appealing alternative to Spanish coercion, the French also practiced dissimulation in these friendships as they pursued alliances with the richest and most powerful native leaders in the region. According to contemporary physiological theory and early reformist critiques of religious hypocrites, these real and feigned friendships put the French in danger of assimilation by the Timucua and at risk of drawing God's providential rage against them, especially when they ran out of food and became dependent on indigenous hospitality. In the minds of the more devout Calvinists at Fort Caroline, friendship with and dependence on the Timucua and relaxed leadership doomed the colony to failure. Artist Jacques Le Moyne interpreted the massacre by the Spanish as a providential punishment from God, and his account offered a cautionary tale that was meant to discipline future Protestant colonists and assure the elect of their immunity to the wilderness and of God's redemption among non-believers.},

	abstract = {Abstract This article focuses on a 1730s debate about the causes and significance of human diversity, particularly that of Africans, between three French Caribbean clerics: Augustus Malfert, Jean-Baptiste Labat, and Jean Baptiste Margat de Tilly. Their ideas attest to the continuing importance of the biblical account in structuring thinking about human diversity; at the same time, they demonstrate how explanations thereof were shifting from largely religious to secular bases before the publication of such influential works as the Comte de Buffon's ‚ÄúVari√©t√©s dans l'esp√®ce humaine‚Äù (1749). On the one hand, Malfert profoundly ‚Äúracialized‚Äù scripture by advancing unexpected biblical ancestors for Africans, Asians, and Amerindians, and making skin color a sign not only of heinous sin, but of heritable and fixed distinctions. On the other, Margat looked to nature, not the Bible, for the source of physical differences between peoples; arguing that they resulted from a complex interplay of environmental factors, he also asserted their mutability. All three men were well placed to interject what they had learned from their Caribbean experiences into metropolitan disputes by contributing to popular and well-regarded publications, thus participating in the early Enlightenment and engaging individuals on both sides of the francophone Atlantic world.},

	abstract = {Abstract Histories of colonial America in the last 20 years have emphasized European empires and the borderlands where empires confronted one another and the native peoples of the continent. The French colonies of New France and Louisiana did not truly control a vast territory however, only a chain of posts along major rivers. French Louisiana also never developed a profitable staple commodity such as sugar in the West Indies or pelts in New France. This article examines how four French Louisiana explorers ‚Äì Jean-Fran√ßois-Benjamin Dumont de Montigny, Jean-Baptiste B√©nard de la Harpe, Etienne Veniard de Bourgmont, and Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz ‚Äì nonetheless sustained metropolitan interest in the colony by delivering to Paris maps, exploration accounts, and Indian alliances that promised access to vast wealth in Spanish New Mexico or a route to the Pacific Ocean. The four men sensed that information was a commodity which could exceed the value of staple products or, perhaps more accurately, that one individual could amass greater capital in the form of information than in the form of physical commodities, by feeding the desires of and sustaining the myths held by metropolitan officials and investors. De la Harpe and Bourgmont succeeded in winning titles of nobility from the Crown in exchange for their maps and narratives, and retired comfortably in France. Dumont and Le Page were less successful. They offered their knowledge in exchange for investments in further exploration, but found no takers. By the 1750s, a more pastoral fantasy of agricultural fertility was replacing the mercantilist fantasy of gold and silver such as had been found in New Spain.},

	abstract = {The perennial bunchgrass little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium [Michx.] Nash) was examined in a 5-yr study on tallgrass prairie to determine how fire influences its use by bison and its responses to grazing. On unburned prairie, bison grazed only 5\% of the available little bluestem, selecting it only 30\% as frequently as big bluestem, the dominant co-occurring species. On burned prairie, grazing frequency of little bluestem was over 3-fold greater and equal to that of its dominant neighbor. Grazing frequency of little bluestem was affected by plant size (basal area). On burned sites, plants of intermediate size classes were least abundant ({\textless}10\% of total) but were grazed most frequently ({\textgreater}50\%). Small plants were most abundant but were grazed least frequently. Density, tiller numbers, and basal area of little bluestem were significantly greater in annually burned compared to infrequently burned sites but were decreased by {\textgreater} 50\% in grazed compared to ungrazed sites. Grazing shifted the population size distribution toward higher frequencies of smaller individuals ({\textless} 50 cm2 basal area), whereas burning increased the frequency of large ({\textgreater} 200 cm2 basal area) individuals. In unburned prairie, little bluestem accumulates a persistent clump of standing dead tillers that appear to serve as a physical deterrent to grazing. Although burning enhances its growth, it also removes its canopy of dead tillers exposing the plant to grazers. The shift in population structure toward a high frequency of smaller (and perhaps less drought- or grazing-tolerant) individuals may contribute to the decline of little bluestem populations under persistent grazing. Thus, plant growth form, population size structure, and fire interact to influence bison grazing patterns and responses of little bluestem to grazing on tallgrass prairie.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to empirically address evidence relevant to variability in hunter-gatherer subsistence strategies on the eastern Great Plains between 8500 and 5000 cal BP. Various scenarios have been proposed to explain ways in which Plains Archaic groups adjusted to middle Holocene climate change (e.g., increased diet breadth, more intense use of existing resources). However, few models of subsistence change for this time period attempt to understand possible fluctuations in the availability of highly-ranked faunal resources. Given the importance of large fauna to Plains subsistence strategies throughout prehistory, any model of Plains Archaic subsistence must consider the paleoecology of bison. Stable isotopes (Œ¥ 13 C, Œ¥18 O, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr), skeletal biometry, and tooth morphology allow local bison populations to be defined according to dietary preferences, herd-level biometric trends, and movement patterns. In the eastern Great Plains during the middle Holocene, it is suggested that bison herds were local grazers who did not move large distances seasonally or annually. These animals also exhibited consistent seasonal landscape-use patterning that would have made them amenable to human procurement strategies. As would be expected if highly-ranked bison were locally available to hunter-gatherers, most middle Holocene archaeological assemblages examined in this study were bison kill or processing sites. These animals were commonly procured during the cold season through both encounter hunting and small, multianimal kills. In most cases, carcasses were processed for meat and high-return marrow resources. Hunter-gatherers occasionally utilized non-bison fauna (e.g., small mammals, mussels, aquatic fauna, birds) that nutritionally complemented seasonal variability in large mammal resources. This study shows that bison hunting was an important aspect of Early Plains Archaic subsistence strategies in the eastern Plains. However, the decision to utilize bison would not have required a highly mobile lifestyle. Despite having local access to desirable faunal resources, middle Holocene hunter-gatherers transported high quality tool-stone long distances and maintained large burden-bearing canids suggesting, at times, a significant degree of human movement across the eastern Plains landscape.},

To the extent that our theories deny the validity of northern hunters' conceptions of animals and the ontological assumptions on which they are based, however, we legitimize agents of the state when they dismiss the possibility that aboriginal knowledge and practices might serve as the factual basis for making wildlife management policy. In this article, I argue that our refusal to consider aboriginal accounts of hunting as perhaps literally as well as metaphorically valid has both contributed to the marginalization of aboriginal peoples and foreclosed important avenues of inquiry into hunting societies and the nature of human‚Äìanimal relations. I focus on human‚Äìanimal relations as a form of reciprocal exchange and argue that the development of a theoretical framework that can accommodate northern hunters' ontological assumptions is warranted theoretically as well as politically.},

The exchange of animal populations facilitated by the acclimatization societies that were established in Europe, North America, Australia, among other places, had more complicated meanings. Introduced aliens were often appreciated or deplored in the same terms that were applied to human migrants. Some animal acclimatizations were part of ambitious attempts to transform entire landscapes. Such transfers also broached or blurred the distinction between the domesticated and the wild. The intentional enhancement of the fauna of a region is a forceful assertion of human power. But most planned acclimatizations failed if they moved beyond the drawing board. And those that succeeded also tended to undermine complacent assumptions about human control.},

We sampled 27 post oak (Quercus stellata Wangenh.) trees from the Boone Creek watershed in southern Indiana. The period of tree-ring record ranged in calendar years from 1654 to 1999 and fire scar dates (n = 84) ranged from 1656 to 1992. The mean fire interval for the period 1656 to 1992 was 8.4 y and individual fire intervals ranged from 1 to 129 y. The average percentage of trees scarred at the site was 19\% or about 1 in 5 trees sampled. No significant relationship was identified between fire years and drought conditions however, variability in the fire record coincided with Native American migrations and Euro-American settlement periods. Temporal variability in the fire record illustrates not only the dynamic nature of anthropogenic fire regimes but also the importance of humans in culturing presettlement barrens communities.},

	abstract = {Abstract In oak (Quercus) savannas in the Midwest region of the United States, fire continues to play a significant role in its persistence within the landscape; however, in southeastern Wisconsin, quantified fire history records are limited. This study documented occurrences of fire for the last 200 y using 16 cross-dated oak sections from an oak savanna remnant in Kenosha County, Wisconsin. Fire history was reconstructed by: (1) obtaining fire-scarred cross sections from cut down oaks in an area planned for an industrial park, (2) preparing sample surfaces to count rings, (3) creating skeleton plots to crossdate samples, (4) dating fire scars, (5) calculating intervals between fires and (6) determining seasonality of the fire. In addition, a master chronology was constructed for the oak savanna using the cross sections to correlate with precipitation. Throughout the entire time series, only 50\% of the fire dates were associated with significantly dry years. Although the overall Weibull median interval was 4.59 y, fire frequency fluctuations and gaps reflected specific time periods of human activities. Although some studies report a high fire frequency during Euro-American settlement, in this study the mean fire interval (MFI) was 19.5 y in the early settlement years in 1840‚Äì1872 and 4.77 y in the post settlement years in 1873‚Äì1979. From 1980 to the present, MFI was 6.7 y. In addition, the data revealed time periods with no fire events: (1) during early Euro-American settlement (1840‚Äì1872), (2) land fragmentation and deforestation (1904‚Äì1920) and (3) increased industrial zoning (1989‚Äìpresent). Although lightning strikes occur most often during the summer months, the majority of fires that occurred during the dormant season (53\%) were set by humans. These data are essential in understanding oak dynamics and in developing management programs for restoration and preservation of remnant areas of oak savanna.},

Across a variety of sites, NPP was significantly related to precipitation (r2 = 0.37), but much variability was unexplained. Thus, we evaluated the relationship between NPP with meteorological variables and soil moisture measurements in tallgrass prairie sites that varied in fire frequency and topographic position. Annually burned lowland sites had significantly higher NPP than either annually burned upland or unburned sites. NPP in burned sites was more strongly related to meteorological variables and soil moisture when compared to unburned sites. The lack of significant correlation between soil moisture with NPP on unburned sites suggests that factors other than water availability limit production in these sites. When NPP data were analyzed separately by life forms, interannual variability in forb NPP was not correlated with any meteorological variables, but was negatively correlated with grass NPP (r = -0.49). The inability of a single factor, such as precipitation to explain a large portion of the interannual variability in NPP is consistent with the concept that patterns of NPP in tallgrass prairie are a product of spatial and temporal variability in light, water, and nutrients, driven by a combination of topography, fire history, and climate.},

After two years simulated litter samples in contact with soil lost 64\% of their initial weight. Burning caused a 2-3 fold increase in production and a ten fold increase in flowering. Application of mulch, lowered flowering rate; response was proportional to thickness of mulch and length of time it was in place, Artificial shading of burned areas under green-house frames lowered flowering rate. Burning or clear cutting vegetation increased percent N and P in May foliage. A May application of N fertilizer increased flowering and dry matter production. Nutrient release from ash had no effect on flowering or production. Root production was similar on burned and Burn 3 areas; a turnover rate of 0.45 was calculated. Calcium content of roots in May increased after fire and N content decreased. Temperature from -5 to +50 cm and light intensity from 0 to +50 cm were higher on burned than Burn 3 areas. Maximum soil surface temperatures occurred three months earlier on Burn 0 than Burn 3 areas. Soil moisture was never severely limiting to plant growth. Growing season microclimate measurements at 50 and 200 cm were combined into a microclimatic index, which allowed comparison of the microenvironment of three burning regimes. Total flowering was proportional to duration and degree of favourable microclimatic conditions from May to mid July.},

	abstract = {Ungrazed tallgrass prairie plots in the Kansas Flint Hills have been burned annually at 4 different dates since 1928. Time of burning markedly altered the physiognomy and was the crucial factor effecting vegetation change. Late-spring burning, coinciding with emergence of the warm-season perennial grasses, increased grass production and favored Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans. Burning in winter, early-spring, or mid-spring reduced herbage production and shifted vegetational composition by differentially favoring other species. Andropogon scoparius increased with mid- and early-spring burning, while perennial forbs and sedges increased with early-spring and winter burning. Amorpha canescens was favored by all burning treatments. Mulch buildup in unburned, undisturbed plots increased Poa pratensis and tree species and eventually reduced grass production. The long-term effects of annual late-spring burning, even in dry years, was not detrimental to herbage production, species composition, or total basal cover in tallgrass prairie.},

	shorttitle = {Frontier {Forts} of {Iowa}},
	abstract = {At least fifty-six frontier forts once stood in, or within view of, what is now the state of Iowa. The earliest date to the 1680s, while the latest date to the Dakota uprising of 1862. Some were vast compounds housing hundreds of soldiers; others consisted of a few sheds built by a trader along a riverbank. Regardless of their size and function‚ÄîWilliam Whittaker and his contributors include any compound that was historically called a fort, whether stockaded or not, as well as all military installations‚Äîall sought to control and manipulate Indians to the advantage of European and American traders, governments, and settlers. Frontier Forts of Iowa draws extensively upon the archaeological and historical records to document this era of transformation from the seventeenth-century fur trade until almost all Indians had been removed from the region.The earliest European-constructed forts along the Mississippi, Des Moines, and Missouri rivers fostered a complex relationship between Indians and early traders. After the Louisiana Purchase of 1804, American military forts emerged in the Upper Midwest, defending the newly claimed territories from foreign armies, foreign traders, and foreign-supported Indians. After the War of 1812, new forts were built to control Indians until they could be moved out of the way of American settlers; forts of this period, which made extensive use of roads and trails, teamed a military presence with an Indian agent who negotiated treaties and regulated trade. The final phase of fort construction in Iowa occurred in response to the Spirit Lake massacre and the Dakota uprising; the complete removal of the Dakota in 1863 marked the end of frontier forts in a state now almost completely settled by Euro-Americans.By focusing on the archaeological evidence produced by many years of excavations and by supporting their words with a wealth of maps and illustrations, the authors uncover the past and connect it with the real history of real places. In so doing they illuminate the complicated and dramatic history of the Upper Midwest in a time of enormous change. Past is linked to present in the form of a section on visiting original and reconstructed forts today.Contributors:¬†Gayle F. CarlsonJeffrey T. CarrLance M. FosterKathryn E. M. GourleyMarshall B.

	abstract = {Colonial America stretched from Quebec to Buenos Aires and from the Atlantic littoral to the Pacific coast. Although European settlers laid claim to territories they called New Spain, New England, and New France, the reality of living in those spaces had little to do with European kingdoms. Instead, the New World's holdings took their form and shape from the Indian territories they inhabited. These contested spaces throughout the western hemisphere were not unclaimed lands waiting to be conquered and populated but a single vast space, occupied by native communities and defined by the meeting, mingling, and clashing of peoples, creating societies unlike any that the world had seen before.Contested Spaces of Early America brings together some of the most distinguished historians in the field to view colonial America on the largest possible scale. Lavishly illustrated with maps, Native art, and color plates, the twelve chapters span the southern reaches of New Spain through Mexico and Navajo Country to the Dakotas and Upper Canada, and the early Indian civilizations to the ruins of the nineteenth-century West. At the heart of this volume is a search for a human geography of colonial relations: Contested Spaces of Early America aims to rid the historical landscape of imperial cores, frontier peripheries, and modern national borders to redefine the way scholars imagine colonial America.Contributors: Matthew Babcock, Ned Blackhawk, Chantal Cramaussel, Brian DeLay, Elizabeth Fenn, Allan Greer, Pekka H√§m√§l√§inen, Ra√∫l Jos√© Mandrini, Cynthia Radding, Birgit Brander Rasmussen, Alan Taylor, and Samuel Truett.},

	abstract = {Although less than 3 percent of the original vast landscape survives, the tallgrass prairie remains a national treasure, glowing with a vast array of colorful wildflowers in spring and summer, enriched by the warm reds and browns of grasses in fall and winter. This comprehensive manual, crafted by the staff of the Tallgrass Prairie Center at the University of Northern Iowa, will be an essential companion for everyone dedicated to planning, developing, and maintaining all types of prairie restorations and reconstructions in the tallgrass prairie region of Iowa, northern Illinois, northwestern Indiana, southwestern Wisconsin, southwestern Minnesota, eastern South Dakota, eastern Nebraska, northwestern Missouri, and northeastern Kansas. Focusing on conservation plantings, prairie recovery, native landscaping in yards and at schools, roadside plantings, and pasture renovations, the authors‚Äîwho collectively have more than a hundred years of experience with prairie restoration‚Äîhave created a manual that will be particularly useful to landowners, conservation agency personnel, ecosystem managers, native-seeding contractors, prairie enthusiasts, teachers, and roadside managers. A wealth of color and black-and-white photographs taken in the field as well as checklists and tables support the detailed text, which also includes useful online and print sources and references, a glossary, and lists of common and scientific names of all plant species discussed. The text is divided into five parts. Part I, Reconstruction Planning, provides an overall summary of the entire process, information about securing good-quality seed, and the design of seed mixes. In Part II, Implementing Reconstruction, the authors consider ways to prepare and seed the site, manage the site in its first growing season, identify seedlings, and evaluate success. Part III, Prairie Restoration and Management, deals with identifying and assessing prairie remnants, working toward a predetermined restoration goal, and managing restored prairie remnants and completed reconstructions, including prescribed burning. Chapters in Part IV, Special Cases, discuss the uses of prairie in public spaces, roadside vegetation management, and landscaping on a smaller scale in yards and outdoor classrooms. Part V, Native Seed Production, describes the processes of harvesting, drying, cleaning, and storing native seed as well as propagating and transplanting native seedlings. Although we cannot recreate the original blacksoil prairie, tallgrass prairie restoration offers the opportunity to reverse environmental damage and provide for the recovery of vital aspects of this lost ecosystem. Anyone in the Upper Midwest who wishes to improve water quality, reduce flood damage, support species diversity, preserve animal habitats, and enjoy the changing panorama of grasses and wildflowers will benefit from the clear, careful text and copious illustrations in this authoritative guide.},

They also appear as relatively accommodating to indigenous ways of life and concerned to safeguard Native American Christians, by means of segregated mission "reserves," from a morally corrupting French civilization. Such views are challenged by reading the Relations from New France (1632-1673), authored by Paul Le Jeune and other missionaries, in the light of their original, Parisian milieu of publication and reception, and by examining the metropolitan history of the mission enterprise. In partnership with their powerful publisher S√©bastien Cramoisy and coteries of French government officials, wealthy nobles, and merchants, the Jesuits of New France were precocious proponents of a Paris-centered civilizing mission to other parts of the world by means of an expanding, French-imperial state and economy. Their program, urged very publicly in Paris, had implications for poor, socially marginal populations within and emigrating from France as well as for missionized Native Americans. These Jesuits were committed, for religious and secular reasons, to cultivating a trans-Atlantic, imperial culture of French "civility," material consumption and aesthetic tastes according to new elite, urban standards, and deference to new political and social hierarchies. As is seen especially in their steady, if largely unsuccessful campaign in France for a war of conquest against the Five Nations Iroquois, the missionaries at times favored violence and coercion to achieve this vision of French hegemony in North America. The Relations not only raised awareness about the missions among pious Catholics and potential donors, but also propagandized on behalf of royal power and marshaled colonial experiences to influence the agendas of wealthy and educated elites interested in social and cultural change both within France itself and abroad in the expanding network of French overseas possessions.},

	shorttitle = {Between {Land} and {Sea}},
	abstract = {One of the largest estuaries on the North Atlantic coast, Narragansett Bay served as a gateway for colonial expansion in the seventeenth century and the birthplace of American industrialization in the late eighteenth. Christopher Pastore presents an environmental history of this watery corner of the Atlantic world, beginning with the first European settlement in 1636 and ending with the dissolution of the Blackstone Canal Company in 1849. Between Land and Sea traces how the Bay‚Äôs complex ecology shaped the contours of European habitation, trade, and resource use, and how littoral settlers in turn reconfigured the physical and cultural boundaries between humans and nature.  Narragansett Bay emerges in Pastore‚Äôs account as much more than a geological formation. Rather, he reimagines the nexus of land and sea as a brackish borderland shaped by the tension between what English settlers saw as improvable land and the perpetual forces of the North Atlantic Ocean. By draining swamps, damming rivers, and digging canals, settlers transformed a marshy coastal margin into a clearly defined edge. The resultant ‚Äúcoastline‚Äù proved less resilient, less able to absorb the blows of human initiative and natural variation than the soggy fractal of water and earth it replaced.  Today, as sea levels rise and superstorms batter coasts with increasing ferocity, Between Land and Sea calls on the environmentally-minded to make a space in their notions of progress for impermanence and uncertainty in the natural world.},

Through the formation and expansion of an indigenous captive-and-livestock raiding economy, the ‚ÄúInterior World‚Äù challenged the power of newcomers in the Far West.

	isbn = {978-0-295-99141-2},
	abstract = {Dreaming of Sheep in Navajo Country offers a fresh interpretation of the history of Navajo (Din√©) pastoralism. The dramatic reduction of livestock on the Navajo Reservation in the 1930s -- when hundreds of thousands of sheep, goats, and horses were killed -- was an ambitious attempt by the federal government to eliminate overgrazing on an arid landscape and to better the lives of the people who lived there. Instead, the policy was a disaster, resulting in the loss of livelihood for Navajos -- especially women, the primary owners and tenders of the animals -- without significant improvement of the grazing lands.Livestock on the reservation increased exponentially after the late 1860s as more and more people and animals, hemmed in on all sides by Anglo and Hispanic ranchers, tried to feed themselves on an increasingly barren landscape. At the beginning of the twentieth century, grazing lands were showing signs of distress. As soil conditions worsened, weeds unpalatable for livestock pushed out nutritious native grasses, until by the 1930s federal officials believed conditions had reached a critical point. Well-intentioned New Dealers made serious errors in anticipating the human and environmental consequences of removing or killing tens of thousands of animals.Environmental historian Marsha Weisiger examines the factors that led to the poor condition of the range and explains how the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Navajos, and climate change contributed to it. Using archival sources and oral accounts, she describes the importance of land and stock animals in Navajo culture. By positioning women at the center of the story, she demonstrates the place they hold as significant actors in Native American and environmental history.Dreaming of Sheep in Navajo Country is a compelling and important story that looks at the people and conditions that contributed to a botched policy whose legacy is still felt by the Navajos and their lands today.},

This book explores how the production and commodification of guano has shaped the modern Pacific Basin and the world's relationship to the region. Marrying traditional methods of historical analysis with a broad interdisciplinary approach, Gregory T. Cushman casts this once little-known commodity as an engine of Western industrialization, offering new insight into uniquely modern developments such as environmental consciousness and conservation movements; the ascendance of science, technology, and expertise; international relations; and world war.},

The Plains Indians: Artists of Earth and Sky celebrates the extraordinary beauty, power, and spiritual resonance of Plains Indian art throughout time. Richly illustrated, this monumental volume includes a wealth of masterworks from European and North American collections, ranging from a 2,000-year-old Human Effigy stone pipe to a 2011 beaded adaptation of designer shoes. Works of art collected centuries ago by French traders and travelers are presented together with those acquired by Lewis and Clark on their famous expedition of 1804‚Äì6, along with objects from the early reservation era and contemporary works based in traditional forms and ideas. The distinct Plains aesthetic‚Äîintertwined with the natural world, ephemeral, and materially rich‚Äîis revealed through an array of forms and mediums: painting and drawing; sculptural works in stone, wood, antler, and shell; porcupine quill and glass bead embroidery; feather work; painted robes depicting figures and geometric shapes; and richly ornamented clothing and ceremonial objects. Many nations are represented‚ÄîOsage, Quapaw, Omaha, Crow, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Lakota, Blackfeet, Pawnee, Kiowa, Comanche, Mesquakie, Kansa, and others. With newly researched texts by leading scholars, this important book charts the continuum of centuries of artistic tradition and reflects the significant place that Plains Indian culture holds in European history and in the heritage of North America.},

Yet domesticated animals - and the social practices that accompanied them - were central both to the ‚Äòcivilizing mission‚Äô of colonizers and to indigenous American resistance. This paper examines these themes within the context of the Great Lakes and Upper Mississippi region between 1670 and 1730. Drawing evidence from Algonquian and Iroquoian languages and cultural practices as well as from the accounts of French missionaries and voyageurs, I show that the indigenous peoples of the Pays d‚Äôen Haut rejected the positive connotations that domestication held for Europeans, and instead equated domestication with enslavement. The resulting conflicts between conceptions of nature, ownership and tameness had an enduring influence on European-Indian relations. Although this study examines specific patterns of interaction on the New French frontier, it also raises broad questions relating to environmental history and European-indigenous interactions throughout the New World.},

	shorttitle = {Empire by {Collaboration}},
	abstract = {From the beginnings of colonial settlement in Illinois Country, the region was characterized by self-determination and collaboration that did not always align with imperial plans. The French in Quebec established a somewhat reluctant alliance with the Illinois Indians while Jesuits and fur traders planted defiant outposts in the Illinois River Valley beyond the Great Lakes. These autonomous early settlements were brought into the French empire only after the fact. As the colony grew, the authority that governed the region was often uncertain. Canada and Louisiana alternately claimed control over the Illinois throughout the eighteenth century. Later, British and Spanish authorities tried to divide the region along the Mississippi River. Yet Illinois settlers and Native people continued to welcome and partner with European governments, even if that meant playing the competing empires against one another in order to pursue local interests.Empire by Collaboration explores the remarkable community and distinctive creole culture of colonial Illinois Country, characterized by compromise and flexibility rather than domination and resistance. Drawing on extensive archival research, Robert Michael Morrissey demonstrates how Natives, officials, traders, farmers, religious leaders, and slaves constantly negotiated local and imperial priorities and worked purposefully together to achieve their goals. Their pragmatic intercultural collaboration gave rise to new economies, new forms of social life, and new forms of political engagement. Empire by Collaboration shows that this rugged outpost on the fringe of empire bears central importance to the evolution of early America.},

	shorttitle = {The {World}, the {Flesh}, and the {Devil}},
	abstract = {As Anglo-American colonists along the Atlantic seaboard began to protest British rule in the 1760s, a new settlement was emerging many miles west. St. Louis, founded simply as a French trading post, was expanding into a diverse global village. Few communities in eighteenth-century North America had such a varied population: indigenous Americans, French traders and farmers, African and Indian slaves, British officials, and immigrant explorers interacted there under the weak guidance of the Spanish governors. As the city‚Äôs significance as a hub of commerce grew, its populace became increasingly unpredictable, feuding over matters large and small and succumbing too often to the temptations of ‚Äúthe world, the flesh, and the devil.‚Äù But British leaders and American Revolutionaries still sought to acquire the area, linking St. Louis to the era‚Äôs international political and economic developments and placing this young community at the crossroads of empire.           With its colonial period too often glossed over in histories of both early America and the city itself, St. Louis merits a new treatment. The first modern book devoted exclusively to the history of colonial St. Louis, The World, the Flesh, and the Devil illuminates how its people loved, fought, worshipped, and traded.  Covering the years from the settlement‚Äôs 1764 founding to its 1804 absorption into the young United States, this study reflects on the experiences of the village‚Äôs many inhabitants.           The World, the Flesh, and the Devil recounts important, neglected episodes in the early history of St. Louis in a narrative drawn from original documentary records. Chapters detail the official censure of the illicit union at the heart of St. Louis‚Äôs founding family, the 1780 battle that nearly destroyed the village, Spanish efforts to manage commercial relations between Indian peoples and French traders, and the ways colonial St. Louisans tested authority and thwarted traditional norms. Patricia Cleary argues that St. Louis residents possessed a remarkable willingness to adapt and innovate, which enabled them to survive the many challenges they faced.           The interior regions of the U.S. have been largely relegated to the margins of colonial American history, even though their early times were just as dynamic and significant as those that occurred back east. The World, the Flesh, and the Devil is an inclusive, wide-ranging, and overdue account of the Gateway city‚Äôs earliest years, and this engaging book contributes to a comprehensive national history by revealing the untold stories of Upper Louisiana‚Äôs capital.},

Even as American expansion limited the geographic scope of Indian lands, the extension of American territories and authority raised important questions about the political status of these Indians as individuals as well as nations within the growing republic. More specifically, the national narrative and even the prominent images of Indian removal cast the eastern Indians as exiles who were constantly pushed beyond the edges of American settlement.

The availability of grazing land and the value and ease of raising crops such as tobacco facilitated the development of less labor-intensive free-range husbandry. Royal governors, proprietors of large land grants, small farmers, and decisionmakers in London had little legal precedent regarding disposition of livestock that survived in "the wilde" and later became the subjects of conflicting claims. Such issues diminished considerably by the 18th century as the international market for grain and the advent of cheap labor in the form of slaves made wheat, maize, and other grain crops more profitable. These factors and reduced amounts of open grazing land forced a readaptation to traditional animal husbandry practices in the Chesapeake, as free-range husbandry found itself displaced to large regions of meadowlands in western portions of the colonies.},

	abstract = {European colonization of North America had its origins in the expansion of European capitalism. But, on the ground, what occurred during the 16th and 17th centuries was the encountering of certain European nations by certain native peoples. Our present field of interest is the particular nature of the encounter between Amerindians and the French, expressed in cultural m√©tissage (mixture or hybridity) and political alliances, since this interaction contains all the ingredients that would lend distinctive colors to the new colonial societies. Exploration of European-Amerindian contacts on the part of archaeologists has already resulted in numerous studies focused on the economy, particularly with respect to the fur trade, or on the newcomers' adaptations to a different environment. For the past few years, however, the author has attempted to approach the issue from another angle, that of representations. It is hoped that this approach will lead to a better understanding of the encounter and shed light on the elusive perceptions of that encounter deep in the minds of the actors involved. The thesis presented here is that a true compatibility existed between representations of the world by the French and by the Amerindians, that this compatibility explains the special nature of the relation between the two groups, and, finally, that the archaeological remains left behind by the two groups lend support to the argument for compatibility, enabling the author to make an original contribution to the comprehension of this encounter. The problem of colonial origins in New France may be approached within a dynamic framework whose main stages are linked one to another in time and space, from Europe to North America: the departure, the passage, the encounter, the contact, the exchange, and the m√©tissage.},

The evidence suggests that of the various proposed dates two do appear to conform to the criteria to mark the beginning of the Anthropocene: 1610 and 1964. The formal establishment of an Anthropocene Epoch would mark a fundamental change in the relationship between humans and the Earth system.},

	abstract = {Part art, part science, part anthropology, this ambitious project presents an early Canadian perspective on natural history that is as much artistic and fantastical as it is encyclopaedic. Edited and introduced by Francois-Marc Gagnon, The Codex Canadensis and the Writings of Louis Nicolas showcases an intriguing attempt to document the life of the new world - flora, fauna, and aboriginal. The book brings together for the first time the illustrated Codex Canadensis and "The Natural History of the New World", following Gagnon's argument that both can be attributed to Louis Nicolas, a French Jesuit priest who travelled throughout Canada between 1664 and 1675.  "Histoire Naturelle des Indes Occidentales", originally written in classical French, has been put in modern French by Real Ouellet and translated into English by Nancy Senior. The "Natural History" presents a pre-Linnaean botany and pre-Darwinian account of living things, including hundreds of species of plants and vivid descriptions of wildlife. It is thoroughly annotated, focusing on the contemporary identification of species, as the result of a pan-Canadian collaboration of experts in fields from linguistics to biology and botany. The Codex Canadensis, currently in the collection of the Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is reproduced in full and provides both a fascinating visual account of wildlife as Nicolas saw it and a rare example of early Canadian art. Gagnon's introduction profiles Louis Nicolas and analyses connections between his work and European examples of natural illustration from the period. The Codex Canadensis and the Writings of Louis Nicolas shows how the wildlife and native inhabitants of the new world were understood and documented by a seventeenth-century European and makes available fundamental documents in the history and visual culture of early North America.},

Adapting themselves to this cultural and ecological borderland between the woodlands and grassland biomes of North America, these Algonquians created an identity as the Illinois and invented a new lifeway as pedestrian bison hunters. Their bison-based economy encouraged important changes in Illinois social life, including a new division of labor and conflicts with neighbors. When the contact era opened, these changes interacted in devastating fashion with the changes caused by the arrival of European colonists. Like other groups, the Illinois participated in mourning war, they suffered from disease, and they participated in trade which intensified their conflicts. But their actions cannot be fully understood without considering their bison economy, which shaped social and ecological realities for the Illinois. This essay shows how the Illinois‚Äô adaptation to their distinctive prairie environment helped to influence their history.},

Berkhofer ranges through a vast archive of recent writings by a broad range of authors. He explicates the opposing paradigms and their corresponding dilemmas by presenting in dialogue form the positions of modernists and postmodernists, formalists and deconstructionists, textualists and contextualists. Poststructuralism, the New Historicism, the New Anthropology, the New Philosophy of History--these and many other approaches are illuminated in new ways in these comprehensive, interdisciplinary explorations.   From them, Berkhofer arrives at a clear vision of the forms historical discourse might take, advocates a new approach to historical criticism, and proposes new forms of historical representation that encompass multiculturalism, poetics, and reflexive (con)textualization. He elegantly blends traditional and new methodology; assesses what the "revival of the narrative" actually entails; considers the politics of disciplinary frameworks; and derives coherent new approaches to writing, teaching, reviewing, and reading histories.},

They weren't. In fact, they were performing an elaborate ruse, having risen up earlier and slaughtered most of the crew and officers. When Delano, an idealistic, anti-slavery republican, finally realized the deception-that the men and women he thought were humble slaves were actually running the ship-he rallied his crew to respond with explosive violence.      Drawing on research on four continents, The Empire of Necessity is the untold history of this extraordinary event and its bloody aftermath. Delano's blindness that day has already inspired one masterpiece-Herman Melville's Benito Cereno. Now historian Greg Grandin returns to these dramatic events to paint an indelible portrait of a world in the throes of revolution, providing a new transnational history of slavery in the Americas-and capturing the clash of peoples, economies, and faiths that was the New World in the early 1800s.},

	abstract = {Since the sixteenth century, European and Euroamerican observers have puzzled over the identity, roles, and sexuality of the berdache, or what scholars now refer to as two-spirit people, in Native American societies in the Southeast. Formerly the domain of anthropological research, over the past generation gender theorists and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) scholars have produced fine studies that aim to demystify two spirits and decouple them from the racialized and heteronormative modes of thinking associated with settler colonialism in North America. As this activist scholarship continues to grow, historians of early America have at best played a marginal role in scholarly debates about two-spirit people. This essay represents a historical intervention in the current scholarly discussions about two-spirit people. Focusing particularly on the Cherokee in early America, the following analysis considers the methodological challenges associated with historical studies of two spirits, and presents insights into how historians might effectively craft more sophisticated and nuanced analyses of people variously referred to as hermaphrodites, sodomites, berdache, and two-spirit people in Native American societies of the Southeast.},

It reveals the variety of ways in which the historical trajectories of nonhuman animals and empires both intersected and informed one another. Beyond merely rehabilitating nonhuman themes in conversations about imperial history, it provides a platform for rethinking both nonhumans and empires as they are envisioned conventionally in the historiography. This introductory article begins by situating this special section as a conversation between science studies and animal studies, on the one hand, and the historiography of empires, on the other. It then suggests ways to reconceptualize agency, subjects, nonhumans, and empire by combining certain shared concerns of subaltern studies and actor-network theory. Finally, it emphasizes the need to integrate postcolonial critiques with emerging scholarship about the posthuman.},

Lally‚Äôs article analyzes the transformation of the equestrian portrait, using this topos as a set of sources through which to examine changes in kingship and imperial politics from the seventeenth to early nineteenth centuries. Both equines and equestrianism were enmeshed in the fabric of the Mughal empire and its successor states: in foreign trade, in its military practices, in the organization of the hierarchy of the nobility, and in the ritual practices, language, and visual culture of the court. Turning toward the horse as a subject of analysis draws attention toward the entanglement of the human and the non human, of rituals and ritual objects, of gift horses and equestrian portrait gifts, and between pictorial practices, texts, traditions, and trade in shaping the cultural dimensions of imperial politics in South Asia.},

Starting with phrenology and comparative anatomy and moving toward anthropology and psychology, Sivasundaram argues that after ca. 1800, race and animality have had overlapping lives. This overlap was productive for Western empires, who were concerned with arbitrating the human in programs of war as much as settlement. The second part of the essay focuses on notions of descent from animals in South Asia with respect to how colonists studied alleged feral children, as much as the placement of accounts of animal descent in nationalist vocabularies. Transgressing and policing the human-nonhuman divide, Sivasundaram contends, was central to the project of empire; exposing empire‚Äôs power requires a widening of critical attention so that nonhumans are worthy of serious postcolonial critique.},

Dogs were integral and essential social actors in Egypt for millennia, but in the decades around 1800 they came to be set apart from society as useless and dangerous sources of pollution, disease, and annoyance. Thus, for the first time in Egypt‚Äôs history, large-scale dog eradication campaigns were carried out in Cairo and the countryside. Violence was not the only strategy for dealing with this changing role of dogs in Egypt. Another that began to develop in the early nineteenth century but that would only fully emerge later was the phenomenon of interspecies affective relations. In addition to offering a history of human-dog relations in Ottoman Egypt, Mikhail‚Äôs article also considers the seeming contradiction of the contemporaneous emergence of human violence and affection toward dogs.},

Drawing on the satirical fiction of Samuel Butler and the work of anthropologist Noelie Vialles, Woods‚Äôs article argues that the relocation of part of the work of raising and rendering sheep for consumption in Britain extended a general distancing of live animal and dead meat on an imperial scale. The outcome of this was not only economic and ecological change throughout much of the Southern Hemisphere, but also the reformulation of colonial flocks to suit the new trade in frozen meat.},

	abstract = {In the twentieth century, conservation biology became one of the forms of expert knowledge contributing to governmental efforts to manage territories and populations. This article offers a situated account of the development of one of the key concepts deployed by biologists for such purposes in the mid-twentieth century: territoriality. It focuses on the work of Helmut K. Buechner, an American wildlife biologist who spent two years in Uganda on a Fulbright fellowship in the late 1950s and remained engaged with East African conservation into the 1970s. Building on observations of Uganda kob made by his wife, Jimmie Buechner, Buechner was able to demonstrate the existence of a complex territorial breeding system in a mammal for the first time. The existence of such a system, like the ability of the Buechners to observe it, was in part a product of the colonial land regime, which allowed dense antelope populations to develop within protected areas where they could be easily studied. The discovery of the kob‚Äôs territoriality encouraged speculation about the fundamental nature of the territorial instinct and contributed to the biologization of postcolonial conservation. In the 1960s and 1970s, biologists began to argue that conservation was more than a ‚Äúnumbers game‚Äù; it also required taking into account nonhuman traditions and social structures. The theory of biological territoriality thus became a conceptual tool for asserting nonhuman claims to land, often in competition with human claims. Colonial and postcolonial land-use regimes, Benson argues, can only be understood by studying such tools for the management of nonhuman populations alongside those applied to humans.},

Excavations began there in 1947, and the researchers eventually defined the suite of pottery types known as the "Danner Series" that is affiliated with the Illinois. Dating of the site has generally relied on the historical record, which begins in Illinois in 1673. That year, Father Jacques Marquette visited the village for the first time. However, little attention has been paid to the protohistoric time depth at Zimmerman. In 2010, the largest archaeological sample from the Zimmerman site, excavated between 1970 and 1972 (and believed lost by the 1990s), was relocated and reexamined. This has resulted in a clearer picture of the mid-seventeenth-century occupation of the site, the nature of traditional technologies at the close of prehistory in the region, and the character of the Illinois' initial response to imported European goods.},

	abstract = {New Materialisms brings into focus and explains the significance of the innovative materialist critiques that are emerging across the social sciences and humanities. By gathering essays that exemplify the new thinking about matter and processes of materialization, this important collection shows how scholars are reworking older materialist traditions, contemporary theoretical debates, and advances in scientific knowledge to address pressing ethical and political challenges. In the introduction, Diana Coole and Samantha Frost highlight common themes among the distinctive critical projects that comprise the new materialisms. The continuities they discern include a posthumanist conception of matter as lively or exhibiting agency, and a reengagement with both the material realities of everyday life and broader geopolitical and socioeconomic structures.Coole and Frost argue that contemporary economic, environmental, geopolitical, and technological developments demand new accounts of nature, agency, and social and political relationships; modes of inquiry that privilege consciousness and subjectivity are not adequate to the task. New materialist philosophies are needed to do justice to the complexities of twenty-first-century biopolitics and political economy, because they raise fundamental questions about the place of embodied humans in a material world and the ways that we produce, reproduce, and consume our material environment.ContributorsSara AhmedJane BennettRosi BraidottiPheng CheahRey ChowWilliam E.

And tameness is a tender, innocent lie."¬†¬†So writes Richard Nelson, award-winning author of The Island Within, in this far-ranging and deeply personal look at our complex relationship with this most beautiful, but amazingly elusive, creature.Heart and Blood: Living with Deer in America¬†¬†begins with the author tracking a deer on a remote island off the Alaskan coast. From there he takes us on a kaleidoscopic journey, visiting such disparate territories of the deer as a hunting ranch in Texas; a state park in California; a Wisconsin forest on opening day of the hunting season; Fire Island, New York; and the suburbs of Denver--where the deer have become so numerous that they pose hazards to landscape, motorist, and pedestrian alike.Nelson examines the physiology of the deer, explaining how its unique digestive system and grazing habits have enabled it to thrive in the varied environments of the United States, whether wild, suburban, or urban. He investigates the different methods of controlling the deer's skyrocketing numbers, from the more "humane¬†¬†methods of relocation and sterilization, to hunting--in all its forms. Nelson also explores the role of the deer in traditional Native American life, takes us with him on a hunt, and awes us as he witnesses the birth of a fawn--an event rarely seen by humans.By the end of this journey we understand the deep reverence in which the author holds this magnificent animal. For to know the deer is to glimpse the hidden heart of wildness itself. In Heart and Blood, Richard Nelson has produced a book of outstanding insight and intelligence that brings us closer to our natural world and, in the process, closer to our own true nature},

Following an introduction to James Wolfe and the famous battle, which has often been regarded as a milestone in both British and American history, the paper maps the various ways Wolfe's death captured the visual imagination of leading history painters of the era. It argues that West's painting had the greatest appeal of all both in Britain and the US because of the various ways in which it managed to meet the demands of the contemporary art market as well as to satisfy underlying national drives and ideologies.},

It argues that the imagery of these portraits was shaped by a number of factors, including the unprecedented nature of the commission, the actual status of the men who were called ‚ÄúIndian Kings,‚Äù and the imbalance of power between the Iroquois and European powers in North America. The finished portraits possessed a remarkable polyvalency, making them useful as tools of imperial diplomacy, a role they served once mezzotint reproductions were distributed in North America. All of the parties involved read the portraits somewhat differently, depending on their interests and objectives, but ultimately all understood that the portraits visualized the material benefits of upholding‚Äîor the consequences of breaking‚Äîthe alliance established between the Crown and the Iroquois.},

	abstract = {Colonial America stretched from Quebec to Buenos Aires and from the Atlantic littoral to the Pacific coast. Although European settlers laid claim to territories they called New Spain, New England, and New France, the reality of living in those spaces had little to do with European kingdoms. Instead, the New World's holdings took their form and shape from the Indian territories they inhabited. These contested spaces throughout the western hemisphere were not unclaimed lands waiting to be conquered and populated but a single vast space, occupied by native communities and defined by the meeting, mingling, and clashing of peoples, creating societies unlike any that the world had seen before.Contested Spaces of Early America brings together some of the most distinguished historians in the field to view colonial America on the largest possible scale. Lavishly illustrated with maps, Native art, and color plates, the twelve chapters span the southern reaches of New Spain through Mexico and Navajo Country to the Dakotas and Upper Canada, and the early Indian civilizations to the ruins of the nineteenth-century West. At the heart of this volume is a search for a human geography of colonial relations: Contested Spaces of Early America aims to rid the historical landscape of imperial cores, frontier peripheries, and modern national borders to redefine the way scholars imagine colonial America.Contributors: Matthew Babcock, Ned Blackhawk, Chantal Cramaussel, Brian DeLay, Elizabeth Fenn, Allan Greer, Pekka H√§m√§l√§inen, Ra√∫l Jos√© Mandrini, Cynthia Radding, Birgit Brander Rasmussen, Alan Taylor, and Samuel Truett.},

They built an empire that flourished in the first half of the nineteenth century, dominating vast areas of the high plains and controlling complex trades, just as a social revolution within Mexico's wars of independence undermined the silver economy and ended its northward dynamism. Comanche power flourished between a struggling Mexico and an expanding US, until the military and industrial power of the latter combined with the ecological vulnerabilities of the Comanche economy to enable the Anglo-American triumph in what should be called the War for North America of 1846-1848. The US claimed a continental West from an uncertain Mexican sovereignty and an assertive Comanche empire of war and trade. The expansion and collapse of New Spain, the rise and fall of the Comanche empire, and the rise of the United States all occurred within an evolving globalization. Spanish North America expanded to 1810; Comanche power rose in the eighteenth century and soared after 1810 as Mexico struggled with the challenges of nation-making; then the United States defeated both to claim continental hegemony in the 1840s. These expansions, conflicts, and changes-all tied to larger processes of globalization-reshaped North America between 1700 and 1850.},

Although empires have long been central actors in borderlands histories, 'empire' has not necessarily been a category of spatial organization and analysis and certainly not one used to describe spaces controlled by Native peoples. By contrast, while H√§m√§l√§inen emphasizes the imperial characteristics of the economic, political, and cultural dimensions of Comanche history (as other contributors to this forum discuss), he also uses 'empire' to characterize Comanche dominance spatially. H√§m√§l√§inen helps us to rethink the spatial dynamics that both shaped and were produced by the encounters between Comanches and Spaniards, French, Mexicans, Americans, and other Native peoples in the Great Plains during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. By analyzing how Comanches came to control vast stretches of the southern plains, The Comanche Empire challenges our assumptions about how Native polities and imperial powers (and groups like the Comanches that H√§m√§l√§inen argues were both) thought about territorial claims and how they employed more nuanced spatial strategies to assert their authority, extend their cultural influence, and control trade and resources.},

Most scholars agree that the war resulted primarily from English belligerence, marked by an appetite for Pequot trading riches and territory. But another sort of hunger was also at work. When English records are read closely for evidence of weather, crop failures, and migration patterns, they suggest that environmental and demographic distress played heavily into the push toward war. Food scarcity, exacerbated by awkward patterns of communication that made it difficult for New England to feed itself, contributed to the war‚Äôs outbreak. This pattern is not limited to early New England; in many other places and times, too, environmental distress and scarcity begat violence. In studying English encounters with New World natives, historians have not yet fully accounted for the role played by hunger in thwarting peaceful relationships. But the story of the Pequot War points to new possibilities for scholars examining the intersection of the early American environment with human actions and new ways of investigating why early colonial efforts sometimes resulted in such violent ends.},

This article examines the impact of Little Ice Age climate and weather during the first century of European-Indian encounters in North America through a peculiar pattern of events found in many early colonial narratives: European and Indian efforts to predict and control weather through prayer and magic. Both textual evidence and high-resolution climate reconstructions indicate that these narratives were at least partly factual. Moreover, Native American groups described in these narratives likely did face real shortages of corn in times of adverse weather, threatening both their subsistence and the authority of chiefs and shamans. The encounters occurred during an important transition in European conceptions of prayer and magic, when Europeans were most likely to associate Indian weather rites with sorcery. Although European confidence in the power of their prayers to achieve weather miracles may have impressed some Indians at first, the efforts ultimately created mistrust and mutual suspicions of witchcraft.},

Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, who is the French pioneer of climate history, met Martin de la Soudi√®re, Martine Tabeaud and Anouchka Vasak in 2008. He answered a lot of questions and was insistent about practicing interdisciplinarity, for example with glaciology, meteorology and literature.

Further, methods and significant results of historical-climatological research, mainly achieved since 1990, are presented. The main focus concentrates on data, methods, definitions of the "Medieval Warm Period" and the "Little Ice Age," synoptic interpretation of past climates, climatic anomalies and natural disasters, and the vulnerability of economies and societies to climate as well as images and social representations of past weather and climate. The potential of historical climatology for climate modelling research is discussed briefly. Research perspectives in historical climatology are formulated with reference to data, methods, interdisciplinarity and impacts. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Climatic changes during the late Quaternary have resulted in substantial, often abrupt, rearrangements of terrestrial ecosystems, but the relationship between these environmental changes and prehistoric human culture and population size remains unclear. Using a database of archaeological radiocarbon dates alongside a network of paleoecological records (sedimentary pollen and charcoal) and paleoclimatic reconstructions, we show that periods of cultural and demographic change in the northeastern United States occurred at the same times as the major environmental-climatic transitions of that region. At 11.6, 8.2, 5.4, and 3.0 kyr BP (103 calendar years before present), changes in forest composition altered the distribution, availability, and predictability of food resources which triggered technological adjustments manifested in the archaeological record. Human population level has varied in response to these external changes in ecosystems, but the adoption of maize agriculture during the late Holocene also resulted in a substantial population increase. This study demonstrates the long-term interconnectedness of prehistoric human cultures and the ecosystems they inhabited, and provides a consolidated environmental-cultural framework from which more interdisciplinary research and discussion can develop. Moreover, it emphasizes the complex nature of human responses to environmental change in a temperate region.},

	abstract = {Aim

To review and synthesize multiple lines of evidence that describe the spatial patterns of land use associated with prehistoric and early historical Native American societies in eastern North America in order to better characterize the type, spatial extent and temporal persistence of past land use.


Location

Temperate forests of eastern North America, and the Eastern Woodlands cultural region.


Methods

Ethnohistorical accounts, archaeological data, historical land surveys and palaeoecological records describing indigenous forms of silviculture and agriculture were evaluated across scales ranging from local (100¬†km) to regional (102¬†km) to produce a synthetic description of land-use characteristics.


Results

Indigenous land-use practices created patches of distinct ecological conditions within a heterogeneous mosaic of ecosystem types. At all scales, patch location was dynamic, and patches underwent recurrent periods of expansion, contraction and abandonment. Land-use patches varied in their extent and persistence, and are broadly categorized as silvicultural (management of undomesticated woodland taxa) or agricultural (cultivation of domesticated taxa). Silvicultural patches persisted for centuries and extended kilometres to tens of kilometres around settlements and travel corridors. The dynamics of agricultural patches varied among groups, with persistence ranging from decades to centuries and extent ranging from less than a kilometre to tens of kilometres around settlements. Beyond patch boundaries, human impacts on ecosystems become indistinguishable from other drivers of environmental heterogeneity. These characteristics of patches are evident across scales and multiple lines of evidence.


Main conclusions

Our findings challenge the view that prehistoric human impacts on vegetation were widespread and ubiquitous, and build on previous work showing these impacts to be more localized and heterogeneous by providing quantitative descriptions of land-use patch characteristics. Collaborative efforts that combine multiple data sources are needed to refine these descriptions and generate more precise measures of land-use pattern to further investigate the history of human impacts on the Earth system.},

	abstract = {The decline and abandonment of Cahokia (A.D. 1050-A.D. 1350), a major Late Prehistoric population center in the central Mississippi River valley, has previously been attributed to climatic variability, resource overexploitation, warfare, sociopolitical factionalism, and other factors. Lacustrine sedimentary records offer a means to reconstruct past environmental changes at local- to regional-scales, but few such paleoenvironmental records have been available to understand the role of environmental change in Cahokia's emergence and decline. This dissertation presents multi-proxy sedimentary records from three oxbow lakes in the central Mississippi River valley to establish an ecological and hydro-climatic history of the Cahokia region.
Based on fossil pollen assemblages, charcoal, and stable carbon isotopes, the widespread removal of trees and the expansion of croplands began at the onset of the Late Woodland period (ca. A.D. 400), centuries before the widespread use of maize (Zea mays subsp. mays) in this region around A.D. 900, and well before the emergence of Cahokia as a regional center at A.D. 1050. The overexploitation of woodland resources near Cahokia and neighboring population centers in the likely played a role in the agricultural intensification and regional trade patterns that characterize the emergence of Cahokia, but the paleoecological data do not support the hypothesis that severe deforestation alone motivated individuals to abandon Cahokia.
Shifts in sediment composition and particle-size observed in cores from two oxbow lakes are consistent with deposition of floodwater sediments following inundation of the floodplain by the Mississippi River. At least eight high-magnitude floods are identified over the last 1,800 years, with large floods occurring about once a century between A.D. 300-A.D. 600 and A.D. 1200-A.D. 1850. No large floods occurred from A.D. 600-A.D. 1200, coinciding with a period of midcontinental aridity, together with population growth and agricultural intensification in the floodplain of the central Mississippi River valley. The onset of Cahokia's depopulation and sociopolitical fragmentation around A.D. 1200 coincides with the return of large floods as midcontinental aridity waned. These findings imply that the emergence, decline, and abandonment of Cahokia may be, in part, societal responses to shifts in hydrological conditions caused by climatic variability.},

	abstract = {Drought is among the most costly natural hazards affecting the United States, averaging \$6 to \$8 billion annually in damages, primarily in crop losses. Mitigating the impacts of drought through planning and preparedness has the potential to save billions of dollars. We used a new long tree-ring chronology developed from the central U.S. to reconstruct annual drought and characterize past drought duration, frequency, and cycles in the U.S. Corn Belt region during the last millennium. This is the first paleoclimate reconstruction achieved with subfossil oak wood in the U.S. and increases the current dendroclimatic record in the central U.S. agricultural region by over 500 years. A tree ring-width drought response function was calibrated and verified against monthly instrumental Palmer Hydrologic Drought Index (PHDI) during the summer season (JJA). Separate reconstructions tailored to emphasize high-frequency and low-frequency variations indicate that drought conditions over the period of instrumental records (since 1895) do not exhibit the full range of variability, severity, or duration of droughts during the last millennium. For example, three years in the last millennium were drier than 1934, a classic Dust-Bowl year and the driest year of the instrumental period. Thirteen decadal to multidecadal droughts (i.e., ‚â•10 years) occurred during the last millennium ‚Äì the longest lasting sixty-one years and centered on the late twelfth century. Reconstructions exhibited quasi-periodicity at bidecadal and century-scale periods. Significant rhythms in drought were identified near 20-yr and 128-yr periods. The tree-ring drought reconstruction shows promise in providing new information about long-term climate variability in the agricultural regions that could potentially span multimillennia. We postulate that tree-ring chronologies (i.e., tree growth), thus far under-utilized in agricultural applications, have the potential to match contributions of instrumental climate data.},

	abstract = {We compared high-resolution reconstructions of peatland water-table depth at two raised bogs in the western Great Lakes region separated by ‚àº1000 km. The sites included Minden Bog in southeastern Michigan and Hole-in-the-Bog in north-central Minnesota. Our objectives were to 1) determine whether large, decadal to multidecadal droughts of the past 2000 yrs were spatially and temporally coherent across the region, and 2) assess the underlying mechanisms of widespread droughts in the region. We found a strong correlation between bog-inferred records of moisture variability in the two regions (r = 0.53). Between 2100 and 600 BP, extreme drought events centered on 1850, 1800, 1650, 1000, 800, and 700 BP are recorded in both regions. Many of these drought events were contemporaneous with large droughts already documented at sites far to the west in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains. To identify potential modern climate analogues, we used empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to reveal spatial modes of variability in drought and precipitation records of North America for the past century. The first EOFs of annual precipitation and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) were similar to each other, and consistent with a pattern of widespread continental drought. Correlations between these EOFs and annual sea surface temperatures (SSTs) indicate strong relationships to SSTs in both the Atlantic and Pacific basins. We hypothesize that widespread droughts between 1000 and 700 BP were related to amplification of a spatial mode of moisture variability associated with an anomalously warm North Atlantic, a warm mid-latitude North Pacific, and an anomalously cold Tropical Pacific. A more extensive network of hydroclimate records, developed using a consistent set of methods and proxies, could be used in conjunction with high-resolution records of past SSTs to test this hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Severe drought is the greatest recurring natural disaster to strike North America. A remarkable network of centuries-long annual tree-ring chronologies has now allowed for the reconstruction of past drought over North America covering the past 1000 or more years in most regions. These reconstructions reveal the occurrence of past ‚Äúmegadroughts‚Äù of unprecedented severity and duration, ones that have never been experienced by modern societies in North America. There is strong archaeological evidence for the destabilizing influence of these past droughts on advanced agricultural societies, examples that should resonate today given the increasing vulnerability of modern water-based systems to relatively short-term droughts. Understanding how these megadroughts develop and persist is a timely scientific problem. Very recently, climate models have succeeded in simulating all of the major droughts over North America from the Civil War to the severe 1998‚Äì2004 drought in the western U.S. These numerical experiments indicate the dominating importance of tropical Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in determining how much precipitation falls over large parts of North America. Of central importance to drought formation is the development of cool ‚ÄúLa Ni√±a-like‚Äù SSTs in the eastern tropical Pacific region. This development appears to be partially linked to changes in radiative forcing over that region, which affects the Bjerknes feedback mechanism of the ENSO cycle there. Paradoxically, warmer conditions over the tropical Pacific region lead to the development of cool La Ni√±a-like SSTs there, which is drought inducing over North America. Whether or not this process will lead to a greater prevalence of drought in the future as the world warms due to accumulating greenhouse gases is unclear at this time.},

Aeolian sand sheets are interbedded with peat that accumulated in interdunes throughout much of the Holocene. The youngest of these sand sheets was deposited between 950 and 650 cal.

Sand sheets could only have advanced across the interdunes if the local groundwater‚Äò ow systems that maintain interdune wetlands were temporarily reduced or eliminated by a reduction in recharge. Both reduced recharge and upland aeolian activity are best explained by regional megadrought.},

Severe droughts of the twentieth century have had large impacts on economies, society, and the environment, especially in the Great Plains. However, the instrumental record of the last 100 years contains only a limited subset of drought realizations. One must turn to the paleoclimatic record to examine the full range of past drought variability, including the range of magnitude and duration, and thus gain the improved understanding needed for society to anticipate and plan for droughts of the future. Historical documents, tree rings, archaeological remains, lake sediment, and geomorphic data make it clear that the droughts of the twentieth century, including those of the 1930s and 1950s, were eclipsed several times by droughts earlier in the last 2000 years, and as recently as the late sixteenth century. In general, some droughts prior to 1600 appear to be characterized by longer duration (i.e., multidecadal) and greater spatial extent than those of the twentieth century. The authors' assessment of the full range of past natural drought variability, deduced from a comprehensive review of the paleoclimatic literature, suggests that droughts more severe than those of the 1930s and 1950s are likely to occur in the future, a likelihood that might be exacerbated by greenhouse warming in the next century. Persistence conditions that lead to decadal-scale drought may be related to low-frequency variations, or base-state shifts, in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, although more research is needed to understand the mechanisms of severe drought.},

	abstract = {This review of late-Holocene palaeoclimatology represents the results from a PAGES/CLIVAR Intersection Panel meeting that took place in June 2006. The review is in three parts: the principal high-resolution proxy disciplines (trees, corals, ice cores and documentary evidence), emphasizing current issues in their use for climate reconstruction; the various approaches that have been adopted to combine multiple climate proxy records to provide estimates of past annual-to-decadal timescale Northern Hemisphere surface temperatures and other climate variables, such as large-scale circulation indices; and the forcing histories used in climate model simulations of the past millennium. We discuss the need to develop a framework through which current and new approaches to interpreting these proxy data may be rigorously assessed using pseudo-proxies derived from climate model runs, where the `answer' is known. The article concludes with a list of recommendations. First, more raw proxy data are required from the diverse disciplines and from more locations, as well as replication, for all proxy sources, of the basic raw measurements to improve absolute dating, and to better distinguish the proxy climate signal from noise. Second, more effort is required to improve the understanding of what individual proxies respond to, supported by more site measurements and process studies. These activities should also be mindful of the correlation structure of instrumental data, indicating which adjacent proxy records ought to be in agreement and which not. Third, large-scale climate reconstructions should be attempted using a wide variety of techniques, emphasizing those for which quantified errors can be estimated at specified timescales. Fourth, a greater use of climate model simulations is needed to guide the choice of reconstruction techniques (the pseudo-proxy concept) and possibly help determine where, given limited resources, future sampling should be concentrated.},

	abstract = {Palaeoclimatology provides our only means of assessing climatic variations before the beginning of instrumental records. The various proxy variables used, however, have a number of limitations which must be adequately addressed and understood. Besides their obvious spatial and seasonal limitations, different proxies are also potentially limited in their ability to represent climatic variations over a range of different timescales. Simple correlations with instrumental data over the period since ad 1881 give some guide to which are the better proxies, indicating that coral- and ice-core-based reconstructions are poorer than tree-ring and historical ones. However, the quality of many proxy time series can deteriorate during earlier times. Suggestions are made for assessing proxy quality over longer periods than the last century by intercomparing neighbouring proxies and, by comparisons with less temporally resolved proxies such as borehole temperatures. We have averaged 17 temperature reconstructions (representing various seasons of the year), all extending back at least to the mid-seventeenth century, to form two annually resolved hemispheric series (NH10 and SH7). Over the 1901‚Äì91 period, NH10 has 36\% variance in common with average NH summer (June to August) temperatures and 70\% on decadal timescales. SH7 has 16\% variance in common with average SH summer (December to February) temperatures and 49\% on decadal timescales, markedly poorer than the reconstructed NH series. The coldest year of the millennium over the NH is ad 1601, the coldest decade 1691‚Äì1700 and the seventeenth is the coldest century. A Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is performed on yearly values for the 17 reconstructions over the period ad 1660‚Äì1970. The correlation between PC1 and NH10 is 0.92, even though PC1 explains only 13.6\% of the total variance of all 17 series. Similar PCA is performed on thousand-year-long General Circulation Model (GCM) data from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and the Hadley Centre (HADCM2), sampling these for the same locations and seasons as the proxy data. For GFDL, the correlation between its PC1 and its NH10 is 0.89, while for HADCM2 the PCs group markedly differently. Cross-spectral analyses are performed on the proxy data and the GFDL model data at two different frequency bands (0.02 and 0.03 cycles per year). Both analyses suggest that there is no large-scale coherency in the series on these timescales. This implies that if the proxy data are meaningful, it should be relatively straightforward to detect a coherent near-global anthropogenic signal in surface temperature data.},

Here we resolve these inconsistencies and show that large eruptions in the tropics and high latitudes were primary drivers of interannual-to-decadal temperature variability in the Northern Hemisphere during the past 2,500 years. Our results are based on new records of atmospheric aerosol loading developed from high-resolution, multi-parameter measurements from an array of Greenland and Antarctic ice cores as well as distinctive age markers to constrain chronologies. Overall, cooling was proportional to the magnitude of volcanic forcing and persisted for up to ten years after some of the largest eruptive episodes. Our revised timescale more firmly implicates volcanic eruptions as catalysts in the major sixth-century pandemics, famines, and socioeconomic disruptions in Eurasia and Mesoamerica while allowing multi-millennium quantification of climate response to volcanic forcing.},

	abstract = {Timber resources were essential for maintaining the fleets that controlled Spain's transatlantic empire in the sixteenth century. This article argues that although the forest clearances for building the Armada during the reign of Felipe II (r. 1556‚Äì98) have been characterized as politically and ecologically destructive, this demand for timber as a strategic resource for war marked the beginning of systematic management of Spanish forests. It also connects forest conservation and the replanting of species valued by the navy, such as oaks and pines, with the militarization and expansion of bureaucratic state power. Finally, this article sheds light on social history by describing the ways in which agents of the crown faced practical limitations to their authority, primarily in the well-forested northern regions. To harvest naval timber without disrupting the social order, Madrid had to balance local interests and imperial demands. Even as international conflicts drained the finances of Spain and rapidly consumed its material and human resources, the crown continued to reaffirm the long-standing legal rights of local communities to access forest resources. Still, by the end of the century, Spain had begun using advanced techniques to gather and communicate information about forests in more regions, expanding its forestry bureaucracy into the largest of its kind in Europe.},

Despite the presence of new environmental regulations, poaching arson, and timber stealing became widespread among the Native Americans, poor whites, and others who had long relied on the natural resources now contained within conservation areas. Jacoby reassesses the nature of these "crimes," providing a rich and multifaceted portrayal of rural people and their relationship with the natural world in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries." "Crimes against Nature includes previously unpublished historical photographs depicting such subjects as poachers in Yellowstone and a Native American "squatters' camp" at the Grand Canyon. This study demonstrates the importance of considering class for understanding environmental history and opens a new perspective on the social history of rural and poor people a century age."--Jacket of 2001 edition},

During the violent European invasions, the region‚Äôs Algonquian-speaking Natives were navigators, boatbuilders, fishermen, pirates, and merchants who became active players in the emergence of the Atlantic World. Drawing from a wide range of English, Dutch, and archeological sources, Lipman uncovers a new geography of Native America that incorporates seawater as well as soil. Looking past Europeans‚Äô arbitrary land boundaries, he reveals unseen links between local episodes and global events on distant shores. ¬† Lipman‚Äôs book ‚Äúsuccessfully redirects the way we look at a familiar history‚Äù (Neal Salisbury, Smith College).

	abstract = {In accounts of French colonial activity and cultural encounters in North America in the seventeenth century, Jesuit missionaries typically appear as ambivalent toward the political, economic, and "civilizing" aims of French empire builders in Paris and Qu√©bec. They also appear as relatively accommodating to indigenous ways of life and concerned to safeguard Native American Christians, by means of segregated mission "reserves," from a morally corrupting French civilization. Such views are challenged by reading the Relations from New France (1632-1673), authored by Paul Le Jeune and other missionaries, in the light of their original, Parisian milieu of publication and reception, and by examining the metropolitan history of the mission enterprise. In partnership with their powerful publisher S√©bastien Cramoisy and coteries of French government officials, wealthy nobles, and merchants, the Jesuits of New France were precocious proponents of a Paris-centered civilizing mission to other parts of the world by means of an expanding, French-imperial state and economy. Their program, urged very publicly in Paris, had implications for poor, socially marginal populations within and emigrating from France as well as for missionized Native Americans. These Jesuits were committed, for religious and secular reasons, to cultivating a trans-Atlantic, imperial culture of French "civility," material consumption and aesthetic tastes according to new elite, urban standards, and deference to new political and social hierarchies. As is seen especially in their steady, if largely unsuccessful campaign in France for a war of conquest against the Five Nations Iroquois, the missionaries at times favored violence and coercion to achieve this vision of French hegemony in North America. The Relations not only raised awareness about the missions among pious Catholics and potential donors, but also propagandized on behalf of royal power and marshaled colonial experiences to influence the agendas of wealthy and educated elites interested in social and cultural change both within France itself and abroad in the expanding network of French overseas possessions.},

In addition settlement pattern data from these three forts and from the Fortress of Louisbourg and the settlement of Port Royal in Nova Scotia are compared. Finally, a new model is proposed to explain the variation observed between these settlements.
In this new model, frontier outposts and settlement are seen as part of a system of entrepots. These entrepots are at the center of local economies that can be characterized as either economies of extraction or economies of production. Fur trade, cod fishing, and mining are examples of economies of extraction, whereas farming and animal husbandry are considered economies of production.
The local economic system is reflected in three areas‚Äîthe artifact assemblage, the architecture of the fort at the center of the entrepot system, and the regional pattern of settlement. Fort de Chartres in the Illinois Country is a classic example of an entrepot in a local economy of production. Forts Michilimackinac and Ouiatenon are examples of entrepots in local economies of extraction. Archaeological data and documentary information supports this conclusion.},

	abstract = {"This volume of essays not only charts the trajectory of a distinguished Floridian's remarkable career, it also chronicles much that has happened in North American archaeology over the past sixty years. . . . No practitioner of American archaeology has influenced the directions and content of research in Florida more than John Griffin. His work not only shaped archaeology in Florida, it also influenced the development of the field of historical archaeology in general." "John Griffin was one of archaeology's pioneers. This collection of papers spans his remarkable career, mirroring the development of archaeology in the eastern United States."--Jerald T. Milanich, Florida Museum of Natural History John Griffin was held in equally high esteem by archaeologists and historians. Before his death in 1993, he was urged to collect some of his original and path-breaking writings into a volume that would trace the story of his professional life. In doing that, he created a work that documents the critical early years of historical archaeology in the Southeast. ¬† This volume includes 16 selections from Griffin's extensive publication list, which began in the 1930s. Ten of the essays relate to Florida archaeology and history, while the others cover investigations in other parts of the Southeast and the Midwest. ¬†They include an article on bison in Illinois archaeology, Griffin's first attempt to apply principles of ecology to cultural change; a report on the sleuthing that unraveled the story of Chief Osceola's grave and mortal remains; an article on Florida archaeology entered into the Congressional Record by Senator Claude Pepper; a chapter from Here They Once Stood, the pioneering work on Florida missions that he coauthored; and a study of Booker T. Washington's boyhood home, one of the first archaeological studies of an African-American historic site. ¬†Griffin was the first professional archaeologist employed in the state of Florida (1946). His frequently cited scholarship stands the test of time, and he was widely regarded as a friend, mentor, and source of wisdom among his colleagues. As one of them, Kathleen Deagan, remarks in the foreword, this book "offers the kinds of insights into both the past and the profession that can only come from depth of experience in partnership with a continually open and curious mind." Patricia C. Griffin, author of Mullet on the Beach: The Minorcans of Florida, 1768-1788 (UPF, 1991), received her Ph.D. in anthropology in 1988 and today is an independent scholar. She was married to John Griffin for 48 years and in 1996 will accept a posthumous Award of Merit on his behalf from the Society for Historical Archaeology. She lives in St. Augustine, Florida, where she remains active in conservation and restoration projects.},

The identification of an undocumented rock art site, primarily pictographic, in the Hill Section of southern Illinois afforded an opportunity to take a fresh look at the methodologies employed in data recovery and analysis. We herein detail a natural history of our investigations of 11SA557. Our methods involved the generation of five different types of image data, an eight-element protocol for the processes of image collection, and a ten-step protocol for the manipulation of the image data with Adobe Photoshop¬© (see Note 1). Some of the special issues associated with the long term archiving of digital images are also addressed. Our approach was ultimately driven by concerns over the fragile and dynamic properties of pictographs and the application of technologies and techniques that would result in minimal invasiveness, heighten interobserver reliability, replicable results, and the intergenerational availability of one's findings.},

This process requires that colonial and settler colonial phenomena be analytically disentangled. They have generally been seen either as entirely separate, or as different manifestations of colonialism at large. Neither stance, however, allows a proper appraisal of settler colonialism in its specificity. In contrast, in this introduction to this new scholarly journal, I suggest that colonialism and settler colonialism should be understood in their dialectical relation. On the basis of this distinction, in the second part of this introduction I reflect on the need to develop dedicated interpretative tools capable of sustaining an approach to the decolonisation of settler colonial formations.},

Recently, postcolonial scholarship has provided a pathway out of that marginalization. The postcolonial critique of traditional anthropological and historical writing about indigenous peoples suggests a new way to imagine the relationship between American Indian history and other areas of scholarship. The most promising aspect of this critique is the formulation of 'settler colonialism'. That framework first emerged among geographers and has recently been embraced by historians and anthropologists. The settler colonial framework offers a way to conceive of the Native past in a transnational context as well as to understand indigenous encounters with modernity as an ongoing struggle with colonial rule rather than as a campaign to accommodate Native people to 'progress' and 'civilization' or to 'assimilate' them into a nation state.},

	abstract = {This essay revisits the main themes and arguments put forward in The Comanche Empire: indigenous agency; spatial reorientation in the writing of colonial histories; the composition of the Comanche empire and its impact on the history of North America. It also responds to a number of specific issues raised by the roundtable participants: differences and similarities between indigenous and Euro-colonial power regimes; balancing of culture-specific frameworks with broad-gauge political economic analysis; linkages between indigenous agency and indigenous sovereignty in colonial encounters; the question of periodization in writing Native American and colonial histories. Finally, the essay points to new ways of understanding, conceptualizing, and comparing nonterritorial nomadic empires by introducing the concept of 'kinetic empire,' which refers to a flexible imperial organization that revolves around a set of mobile activities and relies on selective nodal control of key resources.},

In the colonial era, the extirpation of wildlife was a sign of the fulfillment of prophecy and the conquest of Indians. But by the late nineteenth century, fears of wildlife decline were so great as to render the Ghost Dance, an American Indian prophecy of game abundance, oddly resonant for a broad swath of Americans. More recently, secular scientific predictions of wildlife extinction inspired such writers as Paul Shepard, Rachel Carson, Peter Matthiessen, and Cormac McCarthy to contemplate (and sometimes to prophesy) global extinctions.},

	abstract = {Surface temperature reconstructions of the past 1500 years suggest that recent warming is unprecedented in that time. Here we provide a broader perspective by reconstructing regional and global temperature anomalies for the past 11,300 years from 73 globally distributed records. Early Holocene (10,000 to 5000 years ago) warmth is followed by {\textasciitilde}0.7¬∞C cooling through the middle to late Holocene ({\textless}5000 years ago), culminating in the coolest temperatures of the Holocene during the Little Ice Age, about 200 years ago. This cooling is largely associated with {\textasciitilde}2¬∞C change in the North Atlantic. Current global temperatures of the past decade have not yet exceeded peak interglacial values but are warmer than during {\textasciitilde}75\% of the Holocene temperature history. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change model projections for 2100 exceed the full distribution of Holocene temperature under all plausible greenhouse gas emission scenarios.
Exceptional Now
The climate has been warming since the industrial revolution, but how warm is climate now compared with the rest of the Holocene? Marcott et al. (p. 1198) constructed a record of global mean surface temperature for more than the last 11,000 years, using a variety of land- and marine-based proxy data from all around the world. The pattern of temperatures shows a rise as the world emerged from the last deglaciation, warm conditions until the middle of the Holocene, and a cooling trend over the next 5000 years that culminated around 200 years ago in the Little Ice Age. Temperatures have risen steadily since then, leaving us now with a global temperature higher than those during 90\% of the entire Holocene.},

          Our goal in this article is to intervene and disrupt current contentious debates regarding the predominant lines of inquiry bourgeoning in settler colonial studies, the use of ‚Äòsettler‚Äô, and the politics of building solidarities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. Settler colonial studies, ‚Äòsettler‚Äô, and solidarity, then, operate as the central themes of this paper. While somewhat jarring, our assessment of the debates is interspersed with our discussions in their original form, as we seek to explore possible lines of solidarity, accountability, and relationality to one another and to decolonization struggles both locally and globally. Our overall conclusion is that without centering Indigenous peoples‚Äô articulations, without deploying a relational approach to settler colonial power, and without paying attention to the conditions and contingency of settler colonialism, studies of settler colonialism and practices of solidarity run the risk of reifying (and possibly replicating) settler colonial as well as other modes of domination.},

This edible native North American plant was the subject of significant, if subsequently forgotten, investigation between the Seven Years' War and the Napoleonic Wars. During this period of ongoing military conflict, imperial expansion, and subsistence crises, colonists, naturalists, and officials also grappled with the possibility that climates were undergoing continuous, perhaps permanent, transformation. They envisioned wild rice as the pioneer plant of a responsive imperial ecology, uniquely suited to weathering all political seasons and untold natural upheavals. Neglecting Native American horticultural practice, they wrote about exploiting wild rice on a larger scale as the realization of a biblical and imperial dream of guaranteed abundance: a self-reproducing, prodigious staple impervious to unexpected developments, including ‚Äúinexplicable‚Äù changes in the climate.},

	abstract = {Pehr Kalm's voyage to America in 1748‚Äì51 produced a treasure trove of observations about climate, soil, and other matters of natural history. A close reading of Kalm's travel journal, published writings, and correspondence reveals a deep ambivalence about the operation of the natural order in the New World. Kalm's fieldwork and interviews with settlers charted processes of species extirpation, degeneration, soil exhaustion, and climate change. This interest in the environmental impact of settlement reflected in great part Kalm's commitment to cameralist science. Kalm's American voyage was a direct extension of his earlier biosprospecting tours in the Old World. He and his Swedish contemporaries hoped to transform the natural order of the nation through schemes of acclimatization and internal colonization. Such ambitions were in turn framed within a universal history of climate change. Kalm's experience in the New World confirmed the global scope of these processes, while stressing the risk and uncertainty associated with projects of climate improvement. In this sense, Kalm's voyage offers an important yet neglected entry point into the history of climate science.},

	abstract = {In the 1690s and the first decade of the 1700s, two of the coldest decades of the Little Ice Age, severe winter weather in the American Northeast prompted adjustments first by Wabanakis and later by English colonists. Wabanaki people had generations of experience journeying through and drawing subsistence from their ‚Äúwinter lands.‚Äù With well-adapted seasonal practices and technologies, such as moose hunting on snowshoes, they knew how to cope with persistent cold and take advantage of periods of stable snow cover. In the Second Anglo-Wabanaki War (1688‚Äì99), Wabanakis launched winter raids against sites in northern New England, revealing a crucial seasonal vulnerability of English settlements. Frigid weather and Wabanaki attacks contributed to a sense of panic among New Englanders in the 1690s. During these years, however, English observers, soldiers, and captives also learned winter skills and strategies from their Wabanaki adversaries, which they used in the Third Anglo-Wabanaki War (1703‚Äì13). In 1703‚Äì4, colonial leaders began sending out hundreds of English ‚Äúsnowshoe men‚Äù to patrol Wabanaki hunting grounds, shifting the power dynamics in the winter woods. By appropriating an indigenous technology, English colonists adapted to a changing climate, provided greater security for their settlements, and dissipated fears of long winters.},

Early Americanists can (and should) make contributions to it that no other scholars could provide. We study what happened when one part of the globe, the Americas, was integrated into the rest after a long physical and cultural isolation.

Until 1822, the Sauk Nation occupied one of North America's largest and most prosperous Indian settlements, the envy of white Americans who had already begun to encroach upon the rich Indian land. When the inevitable conflicts turned violent, the Sauks were forced into exile, banished forever from the east side of the Mississippi River. Black Hawk and his followers rose up in the spring of 1832 and defiantly crossed the Mississippi from Iowa to Illinois to reclaim their ancestral home. Though the war lasted only three months, no other violent encounter between white America and native peoples embodies so clearly the essence of the Republic's inner conflict between its belief in freedom and human rights and its insatiable appetite for new territory.--From publisher description},

	abstract = {This dissertation is a study of nonspeech communication and its significance for mutual acculturation and colonial power dynamics in the context of French-Indian contacts across the Americas in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Most scholars have considered sign-language, pantomime, and other nonverbal means of communication (visual, sonorous, tactile, etc), as temporary, imperfect, and insignificant solutions to the lack of mutual linguistic understanding during early colonial encounters. It is also often assumed that these means of communication, combined with seemingly insurmountable cultural differences, inevitably promoted misunderstandings, incomprehension, and violent conflicts between early colonists and native populations. Seeking to challenge these assumptions, this work closely analyzes the nature, origins, change overtime, and cultural implications of nonverbal and paralinguistic forms of communication, which I argue importantly contributed to the accommodation process and the emergence of cultural hybridity in the early French-Indian Atlantic.
This dissertation offers to expand and refine our understanding of cross-cultural communication and miscommunication in various colonial settings. To do so, it brings in a comparative perspective the experiences of a wide range of French explorers, missionaries, colonial officials, mariners, soldiers, and settlers with a variety of native peoples, cultures, and societies in Brazil, Florida, the Caribbean, Canada, and the Upper Mississippi Valley, from 1500 to the conclusion of the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701. Research for this project was conducted in both published and archival sources, using the original French language versions of the sources, for which I provide new or first translations. The comparative scope of this work brings into question the predominant Canadian-centered chronology that has lead past studies of French America, and seeks to put greater emphasis on the influence that local indigenous cultures and contexts had on colonial developments and in shaping the alliance.
Through five thematic/chronological chapters, my work traces the emergence of a culturally-syncretic repertoire for communication in the early French Atlantic, in which non-linguistic elements were at least as important as spoken words to mediate relations between individuals and groups. Starting with the emergence of shared nonverbal codes during first contacts, the project then explores the process of acculturation as a sensory journey through otherness, then demonstrates the permanence of nonverbal means of communication during and after the mutual acquisition of language by French and Indians. It provides an in-depth look at the role of nonverbal performances in ceremonial oratory in seventeenth-century New France with particular attention to the contest between Jesuit and Indian orators. The dissertation ends with a comparison of nonverbal dimensions of diplomacy in New France and the Caribbean, until the eve of the eighteenth century.},

	abstract = {In 1779, Shawnees from Chillicothe, a community in the Ohio country, told the British, "We have always been the frontier." Their statement challenges an oft-held belief that American Indians derive their unique identities from longstanding ties to native lands. By tracking Shawnee people and migrations from 1400 to 1754, Stephen Warren illustrates how Shawnees made a life for themselves at the crossroads of empires and competing tribes, embracing mobility and often moving willingly toward violent borderlands. By the middle of the eighteenth century, the Shawnees ranged over the eastern half of North America and used their knowledge to foster notions of pan-Indian identity that shaped relations between Native Americans and settlers in the revolutionary era and beyond. Warren's deft analysis makes clear that Shawnees were not anomalous among Native peoples east of the Mississippi. Through migration, they and their neighbors adapted to disease, warfare, and dislocation by interacting with colonizers as slavers, mercenaries, guides, and traders.  These adaptations enabled them to preserve their cultural identities and resist coalescence without forsaking their linguistic and religious traditions.},

At first light they struck, murdering nearly 150 Apaches, mostly women and children, in their sleep. In its day, the atrocity, known as the Camp Grant Massacre, generated unparalleled national attention--federal investigations, heated debate in the press, and a tense criminal trial. This was the era of the United States' "peace policy" toward Indians, and the Apaches had been living on a would-be reservation, under the supposed protection of the U.S. Army. President Grant decried the act as "purely murder," but American settlers countered that the distant U.S. government had failed to protect them from Apache attacks. The massacre has since largely faded from memory. Now, drawing on oral histories, newspaper reports, and participants' accounts, author Karl Jacoby brings this horrific incident and tumultuous era to life.--From publisher description},

In a tripartite typology of space, story, and spirituality, this essay finds that "relation" fully lives up to its 17th-century meaning of 'relayeur,' acting as an interpreter or translator between two cultures, two worldviews, and a European and native faith system. Both Jesuit and native interlocutor changed and evolved because of the process of translation, necessary to convey theological concepts, that transpired between them. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {The role of inter-group conflict as a historical process in the Late Prehistoric and early contact periods of the American Midcontinent must be acknowledged and studied to gain a better understanding of culture change. This dissertation recognizes the significant role of inter-group conflict as both a major force for change and context of culture change. I employ the historical-processual approach to review the microscale and diachronic archaeological and ethnohistoric evidence for inter-group conflict. I emphasize the identification of who was involved in past conflict, and how it transpired rather than addressing why the conflict occurred. The role of war in the appearance, spread and ultimate disappearance of the Oneota is examined as a context for studying macroscale patterns and microscale processes of culture change.
During the 11th --13th centuries, the Oneota spread rapidly throughout the Midcontinent, absorbing, replacing or displacing non-Oneota peoples. Evidence of war includes fortified villages, burned villages, skeletal evidence of violence, massacres, symbolism, alliance formation and settlement patterns. The nature of conflict and the responses of the belligerent groups differed by region and the historical and cultural circumstances of each situation.
After expanding, Oneota populations withdrew from the peripheries of this territory to consolidate at major centers of strategic importance on major rivers and trade routes. Social organization shifted, facilitating external warfare and suppressing internal feuds. Other groups adopted similar settlement patterns with large population centers separated by vast distances or "buffer zones." From AD 1400 to the early 1600s no new territories were gained and none were lost. Practices for peacemaking and alliance building, such as the Calumet Ceremony, developed to maintain the status quo.
Beginning in the early 1600s, populations were destabilized by the indirect effects of European contact. With new incentives and new weapons (i.e., firearms), old enemies took advantage of weaknesses brought on by disease and famine to wage wars of annihilation. Algonquian and Iroquoian tribes pushed westward, driving other tribes ahead of them or exterminating them completely. For the Oneota, large territories were abandoned for more defensive strategies, including new alliances with former enemies and amalgamation into multi-ethnic refugee settlements.},

	abstract = {Human interaction with fire and vegetation occurs at many levels of human population density and cultural development, from subsistence cultures to highly technological societies. The dynamics of these interactions with respect to wildland fire are often difficult to understand and identify at short temporal scales. Dendrochronological fire histories from the Missouri Ozarks, coupled with human population data, offer a quantitative means of examining historic (1680‚Äì1990) changes in the anthropogenic fire regime. A temporal analysis of fire scar dates over the last 3 centuries indicates that the percent of sites burned and fire intervals of anthropogenic fires are conditioned by the following four limiting factors: (a) anthropogenic ignition, (b) surface fuel production, (c) fuel fragmentation, and (d) cultural behavior. During an ignition-dependent stage (fewer than 0.64 humans/km2), the percent of sites burned is logarithmically related to human population (r 2 = 0.67). During a fuel-limited stage, where population density exceeds a threshold of 0.64 humans/km2, the percent of sites burned is independent of population increases and is limited by fuel production. During a fuel-fragmentation stage, regional trade allows population densities to increase above 3.4 humans/km2, and the percent of sites burned becomes inversely related to population (r 2 = 0.18) as decreases in fuel continuity limit the propagation of surface fires. During a culture-dependent stage, increases in the value of timber over forage greatly reduce the mean fire interval and the percent of sites burned. Examples of the dynamics of these four stages are presented from the Current River watershed of the Missouri Ozarks.},

	abstract = {Abstract Grasslands are a widespread vegetation type that once comprised 42\% of the plant cover on earth's surface. Features commonly shared among grasslands are climates with periodic droughts, landscapes that are level to gently rolling, high abundances of grazing animals, and frequent fires. World-wide expansion of grasslands occurred 8 to 6 MaBP and was associated with increasing abundance of grasses using the C4 photosynthetic pathway, a decline in woodlands, and coevolution of mammals adapted to grazing and open habitats. Beginning with Transeau's seminal paper on the prairie peninsula in 1935, North American ecologists debated the relative importance of fire and climate in determining the distribution of grasslands. In the 1960's, a major research interest was the response of prairies to fire, especially the productivity of burned and unburned grasslands. Understanding mechanisms for increased productivity on burned prairies began in the late 1960's and continued into the middle 1980's. During the past 20 to 25 years, grassland research has focused on the coevolution of grasses and mammalian grazers and fire-grazing interactions that affect habitat heterogeneity and diversity across trophic levels. While this paper does not follow a chronological development of our understanding of grasslands, all of these major research interests are considered.},

	abstract = {Fire and grazing occur together in many of the world's grasslands, but their effects on nutrient cycling have usually been studied as if they acted separately. We hypothesized that grazing by large herbivores results in conservation of nitrogen that would otherwise be lost from burned grasslands. We tested this hypothesis in a series of experiments on burned and unburned tallgrass prairie grazed by cattle. We manipulated grazing using exclosures and mowing. Combustion losses of N from ungrazed plots (1.8 g¬∞m‚Äî2¬∞yr‚Äî1) burned in the spring were double those from similarly burned, grazed plots (0.9 g¬∞m‚Äî2¬∞yr‚Äî1). These losses represented about half of the preburn, aboveground stocks of N. The magnitude of N loss was proportional to the standing crop biomass available for combustion. Fire temperatures and energy release were reduced by grazing. We used mowing to simulate locally heavy grazing in patches. In the absence of burning, mowing patches increased the likelihood that a patch would be regrazed and caused persistent reductions in the residual biomass remaining in a patch at the end of the growing season. Mowing did not influence patch utilization or residual biomass when pastures were burned. Thus, the effects of fire on grassland N budgets were modified by grazing, and the effects of grazing on the patch structure of grasslands were modified by fire. We conclude that accurately predicting volatile losses of nutrients from grassland ecosystems resulting from biomass burning may depend on understanding effects of grazing.

	abstract = {Abstract This essay explores the career of Pierre Charles Le Sueur, an explorer, fur trader, soldier, and diplomat in the nominal service of the French Crown at the turn of the eighteenth century among the Indian peoples of the Great Lakes and Upper Mississippi Valley, the Pays d'en Haut. It uses Le Sueur's story to suggest a new explanation for the instability of France's Indian alliances in the Pays d'en Haut that brings current ethnohistorical accounts ‚Äì which have largely emphasized the diversity of, and conflicts of interest between, Indian villages in the region ‚Äì into conversation with revisionist works on Louis XIV's France which have similarly deconstructed monolithic portrayals of the ‚Äúabsolutist‚Äù state with which these peoples engaged. Le Sueur's story ‚Äì his transition from a contraband trader, or coureur de bois, in the Pays d'en Haut to a prominent agent of French empire ‚Äì reveals the layers of bitter political infighting within New France and Louisiana over control of the lucrative fur trade; the gambles and deception that often shaped the dealings of colonial agents with officials at Versailles; and, most importantly, the destabilizing effects that their schemes could have upon the Pays d'en Haut as trade routes conveying powerful means of war into the continental interior consequently shifted, offsetting tenuous balances of power between the very Indian peoples the Crown hoped to galvanize as allies. Exploring Le Sueur's risk-laden and ultimately ill-fated attempts to integrate the powerful Sioux peoples of the Upper Mississippi into existing networks of trade and diplomacy that had long been centered upon their enemies in the Great Lakes region reveals these alliance systems as the often tumultuous entanglement of two equally complex systems: the village politics of the Pays d'en Haut and patron‚Äìclient networks linking these spaces with the court of Versailles.},

It necessarily adopts a selective approach but still offers more breadth than depth. It treats the links between environmental history and other fields within history, and with other related disciplines such as geography. It considers the precursors of environmental history, its emergence since the 1970s, its condition in several settings and historiographies. Finally it touches on environmental history's relationship to social theory and to the natural sciences as they have evolved in recent decades. It concludes that while there remains plenty of interesting work yet to do, environmental history has successfully established itself as a legitimate field within the historical profession, and has a bright future, if perhaps for discouraging reasons.},

	abstract = {This article explores the contradictory effects of state disaster relief on the Inner Mongolian steppe borderland of China's last dynasty, the Qing (1644‚Äì1911). As a Manchu-dominated polity most noted for its unprecedented unification of vast Inner Asian territories with China proper, the Qing had to manage complex environmental dependencies between humans, climate, vegetation, water resources, and animals across diverse borderlands. In Inner Mongolia these dependencies, ordered under what I term imperial pastoralism, were based on sustaining connections between Mongol herders and their livestock, which were continuously disrupted by harsh steppe conditions. Imperial state adaptation to these largely uncontrollable conditions constrained central administrators to provide ‚Äúagrarian‚Äù (grain and silver), rather than ‚Äúpastoral‚Äù (livestock) forms of disaster relief. This assistance helped alienate Mongols from their herds and, consequently, from the pastoral identity on which the Qing northern borderland order was based. This process predates the emergence of more direct and conventional pressures from nineteenth-century ethnic Chinese agrarian steppe migration.},

The author contradicts accepted historiography that found race-based French policies regarding intermarriage and sexual intercourse with blacks not emerging until the late 18th century, and then only in metropolitan France and the Caribbean. The article traces the much earlier development of official circumscription of interracial sexual union between French men and African-origin and American Indian women in Canada and in Louisiana. The 1724 Code Noir in Louisiana prohibited marriage or cohabitation with black women and was more restrictive than the Caribbean-area 1685 Code Noir. Colonial and metropolitan officials became increasingly less tolerant of interracial sex as early as the late 17th century, when the push for orderly plantation colonies became a priority with Paris. This reflected fear that "corrupted" French blood, in the form of mixed-race progeny, would jeopardize order through increased crime and even revolt, while threatening the racial integrity of the French colonial population.},

The boy told La Salle of his history as a captive in four Indian tribes. He described Indian village locations and listed the tribes which had "many" horses. The significance of the information for which he was the source depends on the tribal identity of the captive. It has been suggested in anthropological literature that "Pana" indicated "Pawnee," Ponca, Arikara, Wichita, even Apache. After examination of evidence ‚Äî linguistic, cultural, historical ‚Äî it seems most likely he was a Southern Pawnee, a Wichita. If this was so, then his information substantiates the theory of Kroeber, Brant and others that some Kiowa Apaches were still living in the southern Plains in the late 17th century.},

I interpret the pavilion and animal collections using the sparse administrative sources and the richer literary descriptions by Mademoiselle de Scud√©ry, Jean de La Fontaine, and the unpublished poem of the engineer-fountaineer Claude Denis. Drawing on the theoretical work of Norbert Elias and Michel Foucault, I argue that the menagerie is best understood both as a royal claim of absolute authority and as a model of the aristocratic experience of civilit√©. The menagerie was less a zoo than a living metaphor of Louis XIV's absolutism and the court society of Versailles itself.},

The fledgling nation now stretched from the coast of Maine to the Mississippi River and up to the Great Lakes. With this dramatic expansion, argues author Bethel Saler, the United States simultaneously became a postcolonial republic and gained a domestic empire. The dual, competing demands of governing an empire and a republic inevitably collided in the early American West. The Settlers' Empire traces the first federal endeavor to build states wholesale out of the Northwest Territory, a process that relied on overlapping colonial rules over Euro-American settlers and the multiple Indian nations in the territory. These entwined administrations involved both formal institution building and the articulation of dominant cultural customs that, in turn, served also to establish boundaries of citizenship and racial difference.In the Northwest Territory, diverse populations of newcomers and Natives struggled over the region's geographical and cultural definition in areas such as religion, marriage, family, gender roles, and economy. The success or failure of state formation in the territory thus ultimately depended on what took place not only in the halls of government but also on the ground and in the everyday lives of the region's Indians, Francophone creoles, Euro- and African Americans, and European immigrants. In this way, The Settlers' Empire speaks to historians of women, gender, and culture, as well as to those interested in the early national state, the early West, settler colonialism, and Native history.},

There has been, however, some disagreement over the timing and extent of the abandonment. Our long-term research along the Ohio River in southern Illinois's interior hill country has yielded a substantial corpus of late Mississippian period radiocarbon dates, indicating that depopulation of the lower Ohio Valley occurred at the early end of Williams's estimate. Furthermore, the abandonment was a widespread phenomenon that involved Mississippian groups living in remote settings, as well as along major drainages. Although causes for the Vacant Quarter are still debated, evidence from other regions indicates that regional abandonment by agricultural groups was not a unique event in the Eastern Woodlands. /// Los arque√≥logos, en general han aceptado la hip√≥tesis del "Cuadrante Vacante", es decir, la idea de que la mayor√≠a de la zona central de los EE. UU. cerca de la confluencia de los r√≠os Ohio y Mississippi fue abandonada alrededor de 1450-1500. Sin embargo, existe desacuerdo sobre la fecha y la extensi√≥n del abandono. Nuestras investigaciones del interior monta√±oso del r√≠o Ohio en el sur de Illinois han resultado en un corpus de fechas de radiocarbono catorce que provienen del periodo Mississippi. Estas fechas indican que el abandono ocurri√≥ al principio del periodo propuesto por Williams. Adem√°s, aunque las causas del "Cuadrante Vacante" todav√≠a son debatidas, existe evidencia en otras regiones de abandono por grupos agricultores, que indica que el abandono regional no fue un evento aislado en los Woodlands del este.},

	abstract = {This dissertation, Trickster Skins: Narratives of Landscape, Representation, and the Miami Nation, reinterprets sites of Miami history through the lenses of narrative and landscape. It combines Miami and Western forms of knowledge to reinterpret the complex relationships of landscape and representation within the Miami struggle against colonization and the narratives that have arisen from this struggle. It tells several stories of a small tribe that remained east of the Mississippi River after the era of Indian removal who have been neglected by the Federal Government and often misunderstood by academia and the general public.
The Miami Nation of Indians of Indiana (MNI) has about 5,500 enrolled citizens. Remaining in their homeland after removal of nearly half of the Miami Nation in 1846, the Miami of Indiana struggled to retain their reserve lands and identity in the face of Federal, State, and local governmental efforts to systematically dissolve their land base and their inherent and reserved rights. These efforts hinged upon representations of the Miami people and landscape that worked to ignore and erase their continued presence in Indiana through various cultural and legal narratives ultimately denying their identity as American Indians and their recognition as a sovereign nation. Despite these efforts, this dissertation demonstrates the creative and continued resistance of the Miami in various ways.
Drawing upon a myriad of sources, this dissertation focuses upon Miami narratives, pictorial and textual representations, efforts to retain their land base, public performance, museum collections and display, and legal battles. This focus examines how the relationships of the Miami people to land takes many forms and are integral to discussions of tribal sovereignty. The findings in this investigation provide alternative interpretations of these sites of Miami history and are informed by Miami narrative traditions.},

Despite the presumed significance of such interactions, archaeologists find it difficult to measure these forms of behavior. An Illinois cemetery consisting of 264 burials dating to ca. A.D. 1300 illustrates the unique information that only mortuary sites can provide on the characteristics and intensity of prehistoric intergroup conflict. In this instance, violent death was indicated by several forms of bone damage. Chronic warfare caused a heavy loss of life (at least one-third of all adult deaths) and contributed to considerable hardship. Available evidence indicates that this conflict was part of a broader pattern of volatile Precontact-era social relationships that featured intergroup cooperation coupled with antagonism.},

	abstract = {Fossil floras and mammalian faunas from the Great Plains indicate that as aridity increased during the Miocene and Pliocene, forests and woodlands were confined gradually to moister valleys as grassland spread on the interfluves which were covered earlier with park-like openings. The initial rise of extensive grasslands probably commenced in the Miocene-Pliocene transition (7-5 m.y. ago), the driest part of the Tertiary, which restricted forests and woodlands and encouraged the explosive evolution of grasses and forbs. Following the fluctuation of Pleistocene climate-vegetation zones, warm, dry Altithermal climate restricted wooded tracts at the expense of spreading grasslands. The rise of the grassland biome was thus due to occasional periods of increased aridity that restricted forests and woodlands and favored grasses and forbs; to increasing drought west of the 100th meridian which created a flammable source (dry grass); to natural and man-made fires on the relatively flat plains over which fire could spread uninterruptedly; to fire that destroyed relict trees and groves on the flat grasslands, restricting them to rocky ridges removed from fire; and probably also to large browsing mammals (many now extinct) that may have destroyed scattered trees and shrubs on the interfluves during the Altithermal. Youthfulness of the grassland biome agrees with a) the occurrence of most of its species in the bordering forests and woodlands, b) the presence of few endemic plants in it, a relation shown also by insects and birds, c) the relict occurrence of diverse trees over the region, and d) the invasion of grassland by woody vegetation. /// Des fossiles de la flore et de la faune des Grandes Plaines montrent que quand l'aridit√© augmenta durant le mioc√®ne et le plioc√®ne, les for√™ts et les bois se transform√®rent petit-√†-petit en vall√©es humides, ceci parce que les zones herbeuses se propag√®rent √† partir des intersections de fleuves qui √©taient pr√©cedemment d√©bois√©es. L'augmentation initiale des zones herbeuses commen√ßa probablement lors de la transition entre le mioc√®ne et le plioc√®ne (il y a 5 √† 7 millions d'ann√©es), la p√©riode la plus s√®che de l'√©poque tertiaire, laquelle emp√™cha le d√©veloppement des for√™ts et des zones bois√©es et encouragea l'√©volution explosive des zones herbeuses et de forbes. A la suite de la fluctuation des zones de climat-v√©g√©tation du pleistoc√®ne, un climat chaud, sec et altithermal emp√™cha l'expansion des zones bois√©es en faveur des prairies. L'apparition du biome des prairies peut donc √™tre attribu√© √† des p√©riodes occasionnelles d'aridit√© √©lev√©e qui emp√™cha le d√©veloppement des for√™ts et des zones bois√©es et favorisa les zones herbeuses et les forbes; par une s√©cheresse accrue √† l'ouest du 100e m√©ridien, laquelle cr√©a une source flammable (herbe s√®che); par des feux naturels et humains dans les plaines relativement plates o√π le feu pouvait se r√©pandre sans interruption; par des feux qui d√©truisirent les arbres isol√©s et les bosquets dans les prairies plates, les limitant seulement aux ar√™tes rocheuses √† l'√©cart des feux; et probablement par les grands ruminants (beaucoup √©tant maintenant disparus) qui pouvaient d√©truire les arbres et buissons √©parpill√©s le long des fleuves durant l'altithermal. La jeunesse du biome des prairies corrobore: a) la pr√©sence de la plupart de ces esp√®ces dans les for√™ts et bois en bordure, b) la pr√©sence de quelques plantes end√©miques dans ces bois et for√™ts-cette relation est √©galement d√©montr√©e par les insectes et les oiseaux, c) la pr√©sence de divers arbres dans la r√©gion, et d) l'invasion des prairies par une v√©g√©tation bois√©e.},

	abstract = {The Poaceae (English pronunciation: /po äÀàe…™.siÀåiÀê/) or Gramineae are the large and nearly ubiquitous family of monocotyledonous flowering plants known as grasses. The Poaceae include the cereal grasses, bamboos and the grasses of natural grassland and cultivated lawns (turf) and pasture. Grasses have stems that are hollow except at the nodes and narrow alternate leaves borne in two ranks. The lower part of each leaf encloses the stem, forming a leaf-sheath. With ca 780 genera and around 12,000 species, Poaceae are the fifth-largest plant family, following the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae.
Grasslands such as savannah and prairie where grasses are dominant are estimated to constitute 20\% of the vegetation cover of the Earth. Grasses are also an important part of the vegetation in many other habitats, including wetlands, forests and tundra. The Poaceae are the most economically important plant family, providing staple foods from domesticated cereal crops such as maize (corn), wheat, rice, barley, and millet as well as forage, building materials (bamboo, thatch, straw) and fuel (ethanol).
Though commonly called "grasses", seagrasses, rushes, and sedges fall outside this family (see Grass (disambiguation)). The rushes and sedges are related to the Poaceae, being members of the order Poales, but the seagrasses are members of order Alismatales.},

	abstract = {C4 carbon fixation is one of three biochemical processes, along with C3 and CAM photosynthesis, used to fix carbon. It is named for the 4-carbon molecule present in the first product of carbon fixation in the small subset of plants that use that process, in contrast to the 3-carbon molecule products in C3 plants.
C4 fixation is an elaboration of the more common C3 carbon fixation and is believed to have evolved more recently. C4 and CAM overcome the tendency of the enzyme RuBisCO to wastefully fix oxygen rather than carbon dioxide in the process of photorespiration. This is achieved in a more efficient environment for RubisCo by shuttling CO2 via malate or aspartate from mesophyll cells to bundle-sheath cells. In these bundle-sheath cells, RuBisCO is isolated from atmospheric oxygen and saturated with the CO2 released by decarboxylation of the malate. C4 plants use PEP carboxylase to capture more CO2 in the mesophyll cells. PEP Carboxylase (3 carbons) binds to CO2 to make oxaloacetic acid (OAA). Then OAA makes malate (4 carbons). Malate enters bundle sheath cells and releases CO2 inside bundle sheath for rubisco to work more efficiently. These additional steps, however, require more energy in the form of ATP. Because of this extra energy requirement, C4 plants are able to more efficiently fix carbon in drought, high temperatures, and limitations of nitrogen or CO2, with the more common C3 pathway being more efficient in the other conditions.},

By examining a largely unremarked episode in Michel Foucault's highly influential thought and considering its connections to foundational assumptions of the linguistic turn, we seek to demonstrate in detail why the premises that underlie both structuralism and poststructuralism (the theoretical movements most deeply implicated in the direction the linguistic turn has taken in history) logically require the denial of agency as a causal force and ultimately compel the conclusion that no change can occur in realities as interpreted by humans. We illustrate the intractability of these logical problems by analyzing unsatisfactory defenses from some of the few linguistic-turn historians who have discussed relevant issues, after which we conclude by suggesting that attention to current work in linguistics and cognitive science may help resolve such difficulties.},

	abstract = {Colonial America stretched from Quebec to Buenos Aires and from the Atlantic littoral to the Pacific coast. Although European settlers laid claim to territories they called New Spain, New England, and New France, the reality of living in those spaces had little to do with European kingdoms. Instead, the New World's holdings took their form and shape from the Indian territories they inhabited. These contested spaces throughout the western hemisphere were not unclaimed lands waiting to be conquered and populated but a single vast space, occupied by native communities and defined by the meeting, mingling, and clashing of peoples, creating societies unlike any that the world had seen before.Contested Spaces of Early America brings together some of the most distinguished historians in the field to view colonial America on the largest possible scale. Lavishly illustrated with maps, Native art, and color plates, the twelve chapters span the southern reaches of New Spain through Mexico and Navajo Country to the Dakotas and Upper Canada, and the early Indian civilizations to the ruins of the nineteenth-century West. At the heart of this volume is a search for a human geography of colonial relations: Contested Spaces of Early America aims to rid the historical landscape of imperial cores, frontier peripheries, and modern national borders to redefine the way scholars imagine colonial America.Contributors: Matthew Babcock, Ned Blackhawk, Chantal Cramaussel, Brian DeLay, Elizabeth Fenn, Allan Greer, Pekka H√§m√§l√§inen, Ra√∫l Jos√© Mandrini, Cynthia Radding, Birgit Brander Rasmussen, Alan Taylor, and Samuel Truett.},

	abstract = {A landmark history ‚Äî the sweeping story of the enslavement of tens of thousands of Indians across America, from the time of the conquistadors up to the early 20th century Since the time of Columbus, Indian slavery was illegal in much of the American continent. Yet, as Andr√©s Res√©ndez illuminates in his myth-shattering The Other Slavery, it was practiced for centuries as an open secret. There was no abolitionist movement to protect the tens of thousands of natives who were kidnapped and enslaved by the conquistadors, then forced to descend into the ‚Äúmouth of hell‚Äù of eighteenth-century silver mines or, later, made to serve as domestics for Mormon settlers and rich Anglos. ¬† ¬†Res√©ndez builds the incisive case that it was mass slavery, more than epidemics, that decimated Indian populations across North America. New evidence, including testimonies of courageous priests, rapacious merchants, Indian captives, and Anglo colonists, sheds light too on Indian enslavement of other Indians ‚Äî as what started as a European business passed into the hands of indigenous operators and spread like wildfire across vast tracts of the American Southwest.¬†¬†The Other Slavery reveals nothing less than a key missing piece of American history. ¬†For over two centuries we have fought over, abolished, and tried to come to grips with African-American slavery. ¬†It is time for the West to confront an entirely separate, equally devastating enslavement we have long failed truly to see.},

Both subsistence and commercial hunting were factors in the decline of these herds. Bison numbers also diminished in response to a reduction of range by competition from exotic European species, in particular domestic horse herds. The Comanche tradition of winter hunting of pregnant cows meant that the herds could not sustain their numbers. The Great Peace of 1840 opened bison herds in the Upper Arkansas River area to new hunting groups, including "immigrant Indians" like the Cherokee, Creek, Delaware, Seminole, Kickapoo, and Shawnee. Indians managed herds through ritual with spiritual herd calls and thus, did not foresee the steady decline of their bison herds.

In doing so, this emerging field of historical study provides us with an overview of the known past in its entirety, from the beginning of time until the present day. In Big History and the Future of Humanity, Spier presents a simple theoretical approach that not only makes big history accessible, but reveals what the future may hold for humanity." "This original new approach interprets big history as the history of the rise and demise of complexity in all its myriad forms, from the greatest galaxy clusters to the tiniest sub-atomic particles. While focusing on energy flows through matter and the circumstances that produce complexity, the author traces the emergence and decline of all the major forms of complexity that have existed, including human societies and their products. Breathtaking in scope, Big History and the Future of Humanity offers provocative new insights into the origins and development of life and serves as an invitation to ponder humans' place in the cosmos in a fascinating new way."--Jacket},

Every aspect of this early anthropogenic hypothesis has been challenged: the timescale, the issue of stage 11 as a better analog, the ability of human activities to account for the gas anomalies, and the impact of the pandemics. This review finds that the late Holocene gas trends are anomalous in all ice timescales; greenhouse gases decreased during the closest stage 11 insolation analog; disproportionate biomass burning and rice irrigation can explain the methane anomaly; and pandemics explain half of the CO 2 decrease since 1000 years ago. Only ‚àº25\% of the CO 2 anomaly can, however, be explained by carbon from early deforestation. The remainder must have come from climate system feedbacks, including a Holocene ocean that remained anomalously warm because of anthropogenic intervention. ¬© Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Although the epidemic struck the semisedentary villagers of the upper Missouri the hardest, it also ravaged migratory bison-hunting societies that were theoretically less prone to sustaining such heavy losses to Old World infectious diseases. This study asks why smallpox spread so widely among the migratory tribes and why it proved to be so virulent. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that climate fluctuations affected the productivity of the grasslands, affecting bison migration patterns and Native subsistence. Food shortages and resulting starvation facilitated the spread of smallpox and exacerbated the disease's effects on individuals and populations.

	abstract = {This sweeping account traces the histories of the Native peoples of the American West from their arrival thousands of years ago to the early years of the nineteenth century. Colin G. Calloway depicts Indian country west of the Appalachians to the Pacific, with emphasis on conflict and change. Calloway's narrative includes: the first inhabitants and their early pursuit of big-game animals; the diffusion of corn and how it transformed American Indian life; the Spanish invasion and Indian resistance to Spanish colonialism; French-Indian relations in the heart of the continent; the diffusion of horses and horse culture; the collision of rival European empires and the experiences of Indian peoples whose homelands became imperial borderlands; and the dramatic events between the American Revolution and the arrival of Lewis and Clark. The account ends as a new American nation emerged independent of the British Empire, took over the trans-Mississippi West, and began to expand its own empire based on the concept of liberty and the acquisition of Indian land. This book offers a new look at the early history of the region--a blending of ethnohistory, colonial history, and frontier history. It features Native voices and perspectives; a fluid integration of a wide range of oral and archival sources from across the West; a reconstruction of cultural histories; and balanced consideration of controversial subjects and issues. Calloway offers a glimpse at the lives of generations of Native peoples in a western land soon to be overrun.},

	abstract = {This dissertation explores imperial policy and the creation of community at the far reaches of colonial American empires in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Engaging debates about Indian-White relations, borderlands, colonial identities, and the nature of empires in early America, it draws on published and archival materials from French, British, Spanish and American sources. The Creole villages of Illinois Country, from their beginnings as illegal fur trade outposts, became thriving agricultural villages with a population of 1500 by the 1750s. Yet these remote colonies had contentious relations with colonial governments that tried to control the early Mississippi Valley.
At the center of this dissertation are questions about community and identity on the frontier of empires. From the start, settlers went to Illinois for reasons that clashed with the agenda of the French authorities, threatening to become autonomous and separate from the imperial system. Jesuits created a mission where they spoke Illinois languages and refused to frenchify their Indian charges. Robert La Salle made in Illinois the first piece of an "imaginary kingdom"---a new fur trade empire which promised to compete with the interests of New France. Meanwhile, fur traders went to pursue their own interests outside the restrictive regulations of New France, engaging in illegal trade, marrying Indian women, and eventually farming. By the time Louisiana authorities began to exercise authority over Illinois, immigration reshaped the colony, but the local community in Illinois preserved a reputation for autonomy and even independence. Approaching this frontier community, imperialists worried about the loyalty of the people who lived there, as colonists actively protected local interests and patterns. The result was a distinctive empire by collaboration in Illinois Country.
Attempting to reconstruct the community and convert its inhabitants into loyal subjects at the end of the French regime, British and Spanish administrators arriving in Illinois in the 1760s attempted new policies of bordering and control on the Mississippi River. Meanwhile, the Creole colonists strategically negotiated the new imperial requirements as they attempted to preserve local patterns intact.},

Native peoples had highly ritualized frameworks for interpreting dreams that stood in stark opposition to the expressed evangelical agendas of the Jesuits. The Montagnais, with whom Le Jeune wintered in 1633-34, used dreams to speak to manitous, who would assist them in finding game and other endeavors. Dreaming itself, with its claims to prophetic vision, was a phenomenon that threatened to override doctrinaire stances. It had the power to erase familiar boundary lines of identity and culture, to express desires either unwelcome or unthinkable, and to force traumatic memories back into the forefront of one's consciousness. Although the Jesuit order in New France labored to bring Native faith in dreams under colonial control, Le Jeune's Relation reveals the inherent strains of imposing a dominant discourse of containment on an indigenous framework of engagement--strains that make themselves apparent in Le Jeune's foray into liminality and his own dream of moose.},

	abstract = {Through the biographies of eighty-five travellers, this dissertation traces the history of the acquisition of tattoos as markers of cultural hybridity crafted through processes of initiation and transculturalization. A subset of "Western" travelers (mainly English, French, American, and Spanish‚Äîalthough several other nationalities are present here as well) became immersed in Amerindian and Pacific Islander societies between 1500 and 1900. When certain conditions were met‚Äîthe presence of frontier space, codified cultural traditions of adoption, tattoos that could be given to those of non-natal heritage, and personalities open to identity change‚Äîthese travelers had their bodies indelibly inscribed with non-Western motifs that represented, or even enabled, their new identities.
These transculturites are contrasted with travelers who acquired souvenir tattoos as exotic tokens or memorial reminiscences. Trends in the practice are traced as transculturalization and its concomitant tattooing began to wane in North America with a loss of frontier spaces toward the end of the eighteenth century and disappeared completely by the end of the nineteenth due to religious and racist objections. Reasons for a shift in the nationality of those who transculturalized also emerges from the evidence‚Äîfrom Spanish to French to English (and to a certain extent American).
Beyond the specific history of tattooing, this dissertation offers a nuanced account of cross-cultural encounters that shows that such interactions were often two-way and that those of European heritage did not always or necessarily assume the dominant position in a hierarchical relationship. It also, importantly, debunks the "Cook myth"‚Äîthe notion that modern Western tattooing originated from contact with Pacific Islanders starting in the late eighteenth century‚Äîas well as the notion that tattoos on Westerners were usually seen as somehow stigmatic or otherwise negative during the period 1500-1900.},

This lens uses animals to explore broad historical phenomena, from industrialization to ideas about gender. Next is a discussion of two recent trends in animal history: (1) scholarship on 'unexpected animals' and (2) evolutionary history, which examines how humans have shaped animal bodies over time.

Its principal concerns are the manner in which historians grant agency to animals and how that agency functions in historical narration. The article examines the histories of animals in Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and North America in order to tease out the similarities and differences of human experiences with other animals. The foundational premise of the article is that humans are animals, sometimes even a meaty prey species, and that, as such, they are not external to nature or, ultimately, different from other animals in this regard. Humans can have violently intimate relationships with other creatures, an intimacy that defines much of global human history. Animals permeate our history and we theirs: tug at the threads and our stories, woven as they are into the same tightly knit tapestry, will not disentwine. The debate regarding whether humans are anomalous and outside nature or separate from other animals is complicated when the stomach enzymes from an animal, whether wolf or crocodile, digest a human being. Therefore, the cultural-constructionist arguments regarding 'the animal'-that our understanding of nonhuman animals is entirely culturally generated-need to be viewed as overly simplistic. My contention is that our reluctance to join the rest of the animal kingdom on its terms, on more natural terms, exposes a lingering devotion to human 'exceptionalism,' one that is inherent in the humanities and social sciences.},

	abstract = {"Perhaps America's best environmental idea was not the national park but the garden cemetery, a use of space that quickly gained popularity in the mid-nineteenth century. Such spaces of repose brought key elements of the countryside into rapidly expanding cities, making nature accessible to all and serving to remind visitors of the natural cycles of life. In this unique interdisciplinary blend of historical narrative, cultural criticism, and poignant memoir, Aaron Sachs argues that American cemeteries embody a forgotten landscape tradition that has much to teach us in our current moment of environmental crisis.Until the trauma of the Civil War, many Americans sought to shape society into what they thought of as an Arcadia--not an Eden where fruit simply fell off the tree, but a public garden that depended on an ethic of communal care, and whose sense of beauty and repose related directly to an acknowledgement of mortality and limitation. Sachs explores the notion of Arcadia in the works of nineteenth-century nature writers, novelists, painters, horticulturists, landscape architects, and city planners, and holds up for comparison the twenty-first century's--and his own--tendency toward denial of both death and environmental limits. His far-reaching insights suggest new possibilities for the environmental movement today and new ways of understanding American history"--},

	abstract = {Colonial America stretched from Quebec to Buenos Aires and from the Atlantic littoral to the Pacific coast. Although European settlers laid claim to territories they called New Spain, New England, and New France, the reality of living in those spaces had little to do with European kingdoms. Instead, the New World's holdings took their form and shape from the Indian territories they inhabited. These contested spaces throughout the western hemisphere were not unclaimed lands waiting to be conquered and populated but a single vast space, occupied by native communities and defined by the meeting, mingling, and clashing of peoples, creating societies unlike any that the world had seen before.Contested Spaces of Early America brings together some of the most distinguished historians in the field to view colonial America on the largest possible scale. Lavishly illustrated with maps, Native art, and color plates, the twelve chapters span the southern reaches of New Spain through Mexico and Navajo Country to the Dakotas and Upper Canada, and the early Indian civilizations to the ruins of the nineteenth-century West. At the heart of this volume is a search for a human geography of colonial relations: Contested Spaces of Early America aims to rid the historical landscape of imperial cores, frontier peripheries, and modern national borders to redefine the way scholars imagine colonial America.Contributors: Matthew Babcock, Ned Blackhawk, Chantal Cramaussel, Brian DeLay, Elizabeth Fenn, Allan Greer, Pekka H√§m√§l√§inen, Ra√∫l Jos√© Mandrini, Cynthia Radding, Birgit Brander Rasmussen, Alan Taylor, and Samuel Truett.},

With contributions from the founders of this unique branch of history, and the work of innovative young scholars, this Companion presents a bold vision for the future of environmental history, as well as a critical appreciation of its growth and development. The essays in this volume are presented in five parts, covering a diverse set of topics that range from American Indian environmental relations, oceans, and food, to borders, culture, and identity. Combining a complete historiography with the most recent research and trends, the Companion pushes the existing boundaries of the field and encourages new directions of study."--Jacket},

But classroom experiences convinced us that Great Lakes environmental history has been neglected, both because of its transnational character and because of biases within the field of environmental history. The Great Lakes have important stories to tell. They are at once representative of the larger narratives of both the United States and Canada, and also demonstrate the exceptional history of each nation. They provide an opportunity to explore comparative and transnational history. The Great Lakes also are fundamentally important in their own right for their industries, environments, and abundant resources.},

In 2008, surveys of Homoptera: Auchenorrhyncha on prairie grasses were conducted from Long Island north to Maine. Multiple prairie-endemic species were found on glades from Rhode Island to New Hampshire, including flightless Cercopidae found only on sand plains. The ranges of 12 species were compared to those of another 50 Cercopidae, Cicadellidae, and Caliscelidae specializing on 15 genera of grasses found in tall-grass prairies. Most support evidence that sand-adapted prairie grasses constitute the easternmost extent of the prairie peninsula that could have come eastward to glaciated New England by following recent glacial moraines before forests re-established themselves in the area 11,000-9000 years ago. This periglacial ecosystem was distinct from a grassland ecosystem in the southeastern states that expanded northwards to Long Island and Cape Cod, MA.},

This global shift in human behavior has contributed to the adoption of strict policies that govern the purposeful and planned use of fire in ecosystem science and management. However, it remains unclear the extent to which modern-day prescribed fire policies are altering the potential magnitude and variation of fire behavior in scientific investigations and ecosystem management. Here, we modeled the theoretical historical range of variability (ROV) in fire behavior for the tallgrass prairie ecosystem of North America. We then compared sensitivities in the magnitude and variation in the historical ROV in fire behavior as a result of (1) policies governing prescribed fire and (2) woody and herbaceous plant invasions. Although considerably more attention has focused on changes in fire behavior as a result of biological invasions, our model demonstrates that contemporary fire management policies can meet or surpass these effects. Policies governing prescribed fire management in tallgrass prairie reduced the magnitude and variability of surface fire behavior more than tall fescue invasion and rivaled reductions in fire behavior from decades of Juniperus encroachment. Consequently, fire and its potential as a driver of ecosystem dynamics has been simplified in the study and management of this system, which may be contributing to misleading conclusions on the potential responses of many highly researched environmental priorities. We emphasize the need to study changes in fire dynamics as a function of both social and ecological drivers, in an effort to advance our basic understanding of the role of fire in nature and its potential usefulness in ecosystem management.},

	abstract = {A high-resolution multi-proxy analysis was used to reconstruct moisture balance fluctuations spanning the last 6500 years and to investigate the origins of interdunal lakes in the central Sand Hills of Nebraska. Detailed paleoecological data from Beaver Lake, plus analyses from two nearby lakes, were integrated to reconstruct regional climate history. Six episodes of multi-centennial droughts occurred, with a dramatic change in overall mean state between 4000 and 3800 yr BP. An extensive low lake stand between 6500-5750 yr BP was likely predominantly climatically driven rather than geomorphically induced.
Paleohydrological reconstructions of five lakes in the Nebraska Sand Hills were compared in order to (1) determine whether droughts of the past 4000 yrs were spatially and temporally coherent across the region, (2) distinguish local variation in climate from regional patterns, (3) compare the paleolimnological results with the existing dune records, and (4) assess the frequency of variation among the sites. Results indicate frequent alterations between high and low lake-levels during the past 4000 yr. Extended droughts were more common prior to 2000 yr BP, while the last two millennia were hydrologically more complex, and climate shifts alternated on shorter timescales. This record refines the existing Holocene drought history of the Nebraska Sand Hills and aids in our understanding of how drought episodes can vary in terms of magnitude, spatial extent, and temporal scale.
Diatom diversity trends were analyzed for a suite of Nebraska lakes to evaluate the sensitivity of diatom communities to various environmental gradients. Diatom diversity of natural lakes showed the strongest correlation with total nitrogen, turbidity, and conductivity, whereas in reservoir lakes and sand pits, diversity was predominantly driven by phosphorus, nitrate-nitrogen species, turbidity, and pH. Differences in diversity trends are primarily a manifestation of nutrient and light availability, which in turn, is dependent on the physical and geographic properties that characterize each lake system.},

This study has focused on the ash-weight of sediment and has derived estimates of ‚Äòsediment yield‚Äô from the landscape, though estimates of sediment yield from watersheds have seldom been made from the quantity of sediment accumulating in natural lakes. An exception is Mirror Lake, New Hampshire, where estimates from a core could be compared directly with sediment yields monitored in the last few years in experimental watersheds in the surrounding Hubbard Brook Forest (Likens \& Davis, 1975). Detailed study of sediment cores can yield much more information than has been presented here. The chemical constituents of the sediments yield information about the chemistry of lake water and runoff from the watershed, while the remains of phytoplankton that are preserved in the sediment show the progress of eutrophication. A recent study of pre- and post-settlement sediment at Linsley Pond, Connecticut, is an example of a multidisciplinary approach to the determination of human influences on lake history (Brugam, 1975).The data from Frains Lake permit a reconstruction of erosional events since Man arrived on the scene. The result is similar to Wolman's (1967) history of erosion in the vicinity of Baltimore, Maryland; his reconstruction, however, was based entirely on analogy with modern watersheds that were experiencing different kinds of land-use at the current time. Thus his estimate of pre-settlement erosion, for example, is tentative because there are no undisturbed watersheds today to measure for comparison.},

A comparison of the modern and presettlement pollen in 23 short cores taken within the lower peninsula of Michigan reveals a varied effect of man's activities on the vegetation. When obvious indicators of human activity (such as ragweed pollen) are removed from the pollen sum, many differences in the composition of the arboreal pollen are still evident between presettlement and modern records. When compared to presettlement data, birch, elm, and willow pollen in the modern data appear in proportionately higher quantities throughout the state, whereas beech, maple, and hemlock are in lower quantities. Within the region of primeaval pine forests, white pine values are much lower and oak values show an increase. Despite these differences in the pollen record, the modern pollen reflect the same basic patterns in the vegetation as the presettlement pollen. Principal component analysis shows the same patterns to exist in the modern data as are in the presettlement pollen.},

However, most of these records are compromised by chronological flaws, making problematic any comparisons with climatic interpretations based on other records (e.g., GISP2 in Greenland). We report here a high-resolution pollen record with a secure chronology constrained by 26 14C dates on terrestrial macrofossils from Steel Lake, central Minnesota. About 11.2 ka cal BP (11,000 calibrated yr before present) the late-glacial Picea forest near Steel Lake was succeeded abruptly by Pinus banksiana and/or resinosa. The Pinus forest began to open 9.4 ka cal BP with the expansion of prairie taxa, and a pine parkland or savanna prevailed until about 8 ka cal BP, when Quercus replaced Pinus to become the dominant tree in the prairie areas for 4500 yr. The close chronological control permits the correlation of key vegetational changes with those at other reliably dated sites in the eastern Dakotas and in Minnesota, suggesting that the abrupt decline of the spruce forest was time-transgressive from southwest to northeast during 2000 yr, and that the development of prairie was time-transgressive in the same direction over 2600 yr. Correlation of key pollen horizons at Steel Lake with those in the high-resolution pollen profiles of Elk Lake, ca. 50 km northwest of Steel Lake, suggests that the well-known Elk Lake varve chronology for the early Holocene is about 1000 yr too young.},

	abstract = {Prescribed burning is increasingly being used in the deciduous forests of eastern North America. Recent work suggests that historical fire frequency has been overestimated east of the prairie-woodland transition zone, and its introduction could potentially reduce forest herb and shrub diversity. Fire-history recreations derived from sedimentary charcoal, tree fire scars, and estimates of Native American burning suggest point-return times ranging from 5-10 years to centuries and millennia. Actual return times were probably longer because such records suffer from selective sampling, small sample sizes, and a probable publication bias toward frequent fire. Archeological evidence shows the environmental effect of fire could be severe in the immediate neighborhood of a Native American village. Population density appears to have been low through most of the Holocene, however, and villages were strongly clustered at a regional scale. Thus, it appears that the majority of forests of the eastern United States were little affected by burning before European settlement. Use of prescribed burning assumes that most forest species are tolerant of fire and that burning will have only a minimal effect on diversity. However, common adaptations such as serotiny, epicormic sprouting, resprouting from rhizomes, and smoke-cued germination are unknown across most of the deciduous region. Experimental studies of burning show vegetation responses similar to other forms of disturbance that remove stems and litter and do not necessarily imply adaptation to fire. The general lack of adaptation could potentially cause a reduction in diversity if burning were introduced. These observations suggest a need for a fine-grained examination of fire history with systematic sampling in which all subregions, landscape positions, and community types are represented. Responses to burning need to be examined in noncommercial and nonwoody species in rigorous manipulative experiments. Until such information is available, it seems prudent to limit the use of prescribed burning east of the prairie-woodland transition zone.

	abstract = {Two methods of reconstructing prehistoric settlement distributions in eastern North America are illustrated. The distribution of Paleoindian projectile points from across the region is examined, employing primary artifactual data at a countylevel scale. Paleoindian points occur unevenly across the landscape, with pronounced concentrations in some areas, notably along the Mississippi, Tennessee, Cumberland, and Ohio Rivers, and along portions of the Atlantic and Gulf seaboards. The occurrence of these artifacts prompts a reconsideration of traditional models of Paleoindian settlement, the appearance of regional traditions, and the emergence of what is known as the Archaic stage or adaptation. Phase distribution maps encompassing the Eastern Woodlands were also prepared for the late prehistoric period, at A.D. 900-1100, 1250-1300, 1450, and 1540. Phase boundaries in this case were intuitively delimited, based on information provided by ca. 50 archeologists from across the region. The distribution of these phases over the landscape, and particularly their appearance and disappearance, provide clues of value to understanding the territorial behavior, political stability, and longevity of complex late prehistoric societies. The two projects highlight the role and importance of cooperative regional analyses. The distributional information, furthermore, offers as much insight about the current state of archeological knowledge as it does about where prehistoric peoples were actually living on the landscape.},

Researchers examining both culture change and paleoclimate make use of similar temporal and geographic scales, and collaborative multidisciplinary efforts are, as a result, highly productive. Climate change, both abrupt and gradual, played a major role in the development of prehistoric and early historic cultures in the region. Initial human colonization and settlement {\textgreater} 13,450 cal. BP/11,500 rcbp was constrained by the location of climate-linked terrain features such as glacial lakes and ice sheets. The onset of the Younger Dry as cold interval, which lasted from ca. 12,900-11,650 cal. BP/10,800-10,100 rcbp, closely corresponds to the demise of the continental-scale Clovis cultural adaptation, the completion of the late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions, and the emergence of distinct regional cultural traditions. During the Mid-Holocene warm interval from ca. 8900-5700 cal. BP /8000-5000 rcbp major changes in vegetation and precipitation regimes are evident, leading to population relocations over large areas. Portions of the lower Eastern Coastal Plain appear to have been largely depopulated, and large sites appear along some of the major river systems further into the interior and, somewhat later, along portions of the coast. These factors, when coupled with regional population growth, contributed to the emergence of monumental construction, warfare, and long-distance exchange networks, and hence the development of organizational complexity. During later prehistory, as agricultural food production increased in importance, fluctuations in climate and hence potential crop yields had varying impacts on societies at both local and regional scales. During the initial European colonization of the region, isolated events like hurricanes as well as longer term phenomena like extended periods of drought or favorable rainfall shaped how settlement proceeded. The combinedarchaeological/paleoclimate record from the past 15,000 years has significant implications for understanding how climate change may affect our own society.},

Examination of the state of preservation of Quaternary palynomorphs provides quantitative data concerning the degree of information loss due to alteration of pollen assemblages by syndepositional and post-depositional deterioration. The percentage, concentration, and influx values for total indeterminable pollen are useful criteria in providing an objective and quantitative basis for evaluating the comparability of pollen spectra within and between sites. Supporting data concerning sediment particle-size distribution, organic matter content, and concentration, influx, and taxonomic composition of both determinable pollen and plant macrofossils aid in reconstructing past depositional environments. The potential is high for deterioration of pollen in sediments from the southeastern United States, although considerable variation is found in both kind and degree of deterioration between lacustrine and alluvial sites of different ages and in different latitudes. Modern analogs are a basis for late Quaternary environmental reconstructions when pollen deterioration has not significantly biased the information content of fossil pollen assemblages.},

	abstract = {The temperate deciduous forest of North America is more diverse than the deciduous forest of western Europe. This difference has traditionally been explained by greater survival in North America of deciduous species during the Quaternary. More recent investigations have shown, however, that late-Tertiary forests of Europe had already become dominated by conifers, with deciduous angiosperms a minor component. During the Quaternary, coniferous species and genera were lost from the European flora, leaving a few species and genera of angiosperms as the dominant trees. Cold, dry, continental climate during the glaciations caused the extinction of conifers; deciduous trees apparently survived these climatic conditions in pockets of favorable habitat in the eastern Mediterranean region. In eastern North America, in contrast, temperate deciduous forests are quite similar to the forests that were present in the late Tertiary. During the Quaternary, relatively few extinctions occurred, although deciduous angiosperms were displaced from the Appalachian mountains, surviving in small populations in the lower Mississippi valley or on the southern coastal plain. Coniferous forests dominated by spruce grew in the Great Plains, and forests dominated by pine grew on the southern part of the Atlantic coastal plain. At the opening of the Holocene, and presumably at the beginning of all the previous interglacials, tree distributions changed dramatically as temperate species rapidly extended their ranges northward. Range boundaries have continued to change throughout the Holocene, as expansions and contractions of range have occurred as the result of climatic change. Quaternary climatic history caused dramatic changes in the forests of both areas, indicating that modern species distributions can no longer be considered relicts of Tertiary distributions. Throughout the Quaternary, species ranges have changed in response to changes in regional climate; many forest communities are of recent origin, having received their present complements of tree species within the last 5,000 years. Forest communities in Eastern North America and in Western Europe as well have been invaded repeatedly during the Holocene by forest species expanding from refuges far to the south.},

This is true, Christopher Wells argues, because the United States is Car Country‚Äïa nation dominated by landscapes that are difficult, inconvenient, and often unsafe to navigate by those who are not sitting behind the wheel of a car.The prevalence of car-dependent landscapes seems perfectly natural to us today, but it is, in fact, a relatively new historical development. In Car Country, Wells rejects the idea that the nation's automotive status quo can be explained as a simple byproduct of an ardent love affair with the automobile. Instead, he takes readers on a tour of the evolving American landscape, charting the ways that transportation policies and land-use practices have combined to reshape nearly every element of the built environment around the easy movement of automobiles. Wells untangles the complicated relationships between automobiles and the environment, allowing readers to see the everyday world in a completely new way. The result is a history that is essential for understanding American transportation and land-use issues today.},

Under ideal conditions it should be possible, however, to interpret fossil pollen percentages objectively by means of correction for observed differences in pollen contribution. This method is described and demonstrated by its application to the Pine Pollen Zone in a pollen diagram from Vermont. The results imply that our previous subjective vegetational and climatic interpretation of this zone has been without validity. The departures of the real situation from the conditions of an ideal model are used to illustrate a general discussion of some of the subtle but potentially important sources of error that must be evaluated before pollen analysis can be used as a reliable paleoecologic technique.},

Dating with 210Pb and 14C reveals two sedimentation rate changes in the core which are associated with the arrival of European farmers; the building of cabins and suburban housing subdivisions on the lake shore. At European settlement in 1700 ad Ambrosia and Rumex pollen first appear, Gramineae-type pollen increases, and Tsuga decreases. Just before the beginning of agricultural disturbance Fagus pollen declines. The chestnut blight of 1913 causes a reduction of Castanea pollen and a subsequent vegetational succession through Betula to Quercus. The sedimentation rate determined by the chestnut blight horizon is consistent with the rate deduced from 210Pb analysis.},

	abstract = {George Rogers Clark (November 19, 1752 ‚Äì February 13, 1818) was a surveyor, soldier, and militia officer from Virginia and the highest ranking American military officer on the northwestern frontier during the American Revolutionary War. He served as leader of the Kentucky (then part of Virginia) militia throughout much of the war. Clark is best known for his celebrated captures of Kaskaskia (1778) and Vincennes (1779) during the Illinois Campaign, which greatly weakened British influence in the Northwest Territory. Because the British ceded the entire Northwest Territory to the United States in the 1783 Treaty of Paris, Clark has often been hailed as the "Conqueror of the Old Northwest".
Clark's military achievements all came before his 30th birthday. Afterwards he led militia in the opening engagements of the Northwest Indian War, but was accused of being drunk on duty. Despite his demand for a formal investigation into the accusations, he was disgraced and forced to resign. He left Kentucky to live on the Indiana frontier. Never fully reimbursed by Virginia for his wartime expenditures, Clark spent the final decades of his life evading creditors, and living in increasing poverty and obscurity. He was involved in two failed conspiracies to open the Spanish-controlled Mississippi River to American traffic. After suffering a stroke and the loss of his leg, Clark was aided in his final years by family members, including his younger brother William, one of the leaders of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Clark died of a stroke on February 13, 1818.},

	abstract = {The height of prehistoric sociopolitical development in the American Bottom, on the Mississippi River floodplain in southern Illinois, occurred from A.D. 800 to A.D. 1200 during the Neo-Atlantic episode of climatic amelioration, also known as the Medieval Warm Epoch. The Emergent Mississippian and Mississippian inhabitants depopulated the uplands and developed a nucleated settlement pattern focused on the premier mound center, Cahokia, in the bottoms. Because the inhabitants affected their landscape by cultivating maize and by constructing domestic and monumental structures, this also was a prime location for an interdisciplinary investigation of landscape changes resulting from human impact.
A variety of paleoecological techniques was applied to sediment cores from two oxbow lakes and two of Cahokia's borrow pits. Away from intensive Mississippian settlement in the bottoms, an upland sinkhole lake was selected as a control site. Regional baldcypress tree-ring data were compiled for a record of moisture fluctuations over the last millennium. Anthropological and ethnohistoric information gave the paleoecological data social meaning.
Good records of Historic human impact on the landscape exist in the oxbow and sinkhole lakes. A distinct ragweed pollen rise and traces of pollen from anthropogenic indicators characterize cores from these lakes. Topsoil erosion from land clearance and cultivation is implicated by high ARM/X, marking influxes of comparatively fine-grained magnetic particles. Late-prehistoric anthropogenic effects are less evident. However, the first traces of anthropogenic indicators with a fair abundance of ragweed pollen and minor influxes of fine magnetic particles may correlate to the Late Woodland and Emergent Mississippian periods.
The few strata yielding well-preserved pollen in borrow-pit cores probably represent wet years. Unequivocal paleoecological evidence for the Medieval Warm Epoch is generally lacking from the American Bottom sediment cores, but two long and intense drought intervals appear in the baldcypress chronology between A.D. 1170 and 1230. Coincident with Cahokia's decline, the dry episodes may have exacerbated social tensions within the Mississippian community. Thus, external (i.e., climatic) stresses may have intensified or expedited internal (i.e., social) stresses and may have contributed to the dispersion of the Cahokia polity.},

	abstract = {The role of climate and fire in the development, maintenance, and species composition of prairie in the eastern axis of the tallgrass Prairie Peninsula intrigued early North American ecologists. However, evaluation of the long-standing hypotheses about the region's environmental history has been hampered by the scarcity of paleorecords. We conducted multiproxy analyses on early and middle Holocene sediments from two Illinois, USA, lakes to assess long-term climatic, vegetational, and fire variability in the region. Sediment mineral composition, carbonate \${\textbackslash}delta \{\}{\textasciicircum}\{18\}{\textbackslash}text\{O\}\$, ostracode assemblages, and diatom assemblages were integrated to infer fluctuations in moisture availability. Pollen and charcoal \${\textbackslash}delta \{\}{\textasciicircum}\{13\}{\textbackslash}text\{C\}\$ were used to reconstruct vegetation composition, and charcoal influx was used to reconstruct fire. Results indicate that fire-sensitive trees (e.g., Ulmus, Ostrya, Fraxinus, and Acer saccharum) declined and prairie taxa expanded with increased aridity from 10 000 yr BP to 8500 yr BP. Between ‚àº8500 yr BP and ‚àº6200 yr BP, aridity declined, and prairie coexisted with fire-sensitive and fire-tolerant (e.g., Quercus and Carya) trees. After ‚àº6200 yr BP, prairie taxa became dominant, although aridity was not more severe than it was around 8500 yr BP. Along with aridity, fire appears to have played an important role in the establishment and maintenance of prairie communities in the eastern Prairie Peninsula, consistent with the speculations of the early ecologists. Comparison of our data with results from elsewhere in the North American midcontinent indicates that spatial heterogeneity is a characteristic feature of climatic and vegetational variations on millennial time scales.},

Examination of the Big Bone Lick dentitions suggests a single kill event that took place during winter or spring. Furthermore, osteometric comparisons of crania and metacarpals between the Big Bone Lick (BBL) bison and western Bison samples suggest that this species adapted to environmental conditions in the eastern US by adjusting developmental timing rather than through overt morphological change. Finally, isotopic (Œ¥13C, Œ¥18O) analyses of bison tooth enamel hydroxylapatite and a unique progression of tooth wear in older age groups indicate these bison were obligate browsers that exhibited substantial differences in inter-annual land-use patterns. The BBL bison assemblage represents a healthy, in situ bison population that successfully occupied a different ecological niche than bison on the Great Plains. Subsistence models that incorporate these animals should consider these important differences.},

	abstract = {In eastern North America, large prehistoric settlements were concentrated in and along the floodplains of the midcontinent, but few sedimentary records have been examined adjacent to these sites to evaluate the impacts of Native American land use on terrestrial ecosystems. Here we report a high-resolution and multiproxy paleoecological record from Horseshoe Lake, an oxbow lake in the central Mississippi River valley that is adjacent to the Cahokia site (Illinois, USA), the largest prehistoric settlement north of Mexico. Palynological and carbon isotope data document pronounced vegetation changes over the past 1700 yr driven primarily by land use, including 900 yr (450‚Äì1350 CE) of sustained prehistoric human impacts. Rapid forest clearance was followed closely by the proliferation of indigenous seed crops of the Eastern Agricultural Complex beginning ca. 450 CE, centuries before the emergence of Cahokia at 1050 CE. Agricultural intensification that included the use of maize (Zea mays subsp. mays) followed this initial clearance, with peak land use intensity between 900 and 1200 CE. A large flood event ca. 1200 CE marks the onset of agricultural contraction and Cahokia‚Äôs decline. Reforestation follows the abandonment of the Cahokia region at ca. 1350 CE. The Horseshoe Lake record thus indicates that regional agricultural activity began abruptly at 450 CE and intensified over the following centuries, well before the formation of Cahokia and other large prehistoric settlements. The evidence that a major flood coincided with the onset of Cahokia‚Äôs decline is noteworthy, but will require corroboration from additional records.},

But individual trees also were freighted with a host of specific cultural connotations: white pine trees signified, among other things, New England, and palms, the South; oaks were often figured as royal, Christian, and male, while apples were a bedeviling mix of intoxicating female temptation and the promise of virtue‚Äôs everlasting life. Trees were symbols, and as symbols they constituted a sylvan literacy on wide display throughout the nineteenth century‚Äôs images and texts. This essay traces a history of sylvan literacy, from its rise in the nature-based cultural nationalism of the 1830s to its eclipse in the early twentieth century by the language of professional scientists. It is also a theory of how sylvan literacy worked: more like poetry than a dictionary, open to multiple competing interpretations, put to contesting uses. Ultimately, this essay contributes to the cultural and environmental history of the nineteenth-century U.S. by arguing that learning to speak Tree can help us more clearly see a complicated, still unresolved U.S. culture that was struggling to root itself securely in a shifting world made by humans and nature, both.},

	abstract = {Endemism is the ecological state of a species being unique to a defined geographic location, such as an island, nation, country or other defined zone, or habitat type; organisms that are indigenous to a place are not endemic to it if they are also found elsewhere. The extreme opposite of endemism is cosmopolitan distribution. An alternative term for a species that is endemic is precinctive, which applies to species (and subspecific categories) that are restricted to a defined geographical area.
The word endemic is from New Latin endƒìmicus, from Greek ŒµŒΩŒ¥ŒÆŒºŒøœÇ, endƒìmos, "native." Endƒìmos is formed of en meaning "in," and dƒìmos meaning "the people." The term, precinctive, has been suggested by some scientists, and was first used in botany by MacCaughey in 1917. It is the equivalent of "endemism". Precinction was perhaps first used by Frank and McCoy. Precinctive seems to have been coined by David Sharp of the Hawaiian fauna in 1900: "I use the word precinctive in the sense of 'confined to the area under discussion' ‚Ä¶ 'precinctive forms' means those forms that are confined to the area specified." That definition excludes artificial confinement of examples by humans in far-off botanical gardens or zoological parks.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide quantitative fire history information  from a historically unique region, the oak barrens of the Interior Low Plateau Ecoregion. We sampled 27 post oak (Quercus stellata Wangenh.) trees from the Boone Creek watershed in southern Indiana. The period of tree-ring record ranged in calendar years from 1654 to 1999  and fire scar dates (n=84) ranged from 1656 to 1992. The mean fire interval for the period 1656 to 1992 was 8.4 y and individual fire intervals ranged from 1 to 129 y. The average percentage of trees scarred at the site was 19\% or about 1 in 5 trees sampled. No significant relationship was identified between fire years and drought conditions however, variability in the fire record coincided with Native American migrations and Euro-American settlement periods. Temporal variability in the fire record illustrates not only the dynamic nature of  anthropogenic fire regimes but also the importance of humans in culturing presettlement barrens communities.},

	abstract = {This paper integrates recent efforts to map the distribution of biomes for the late Quaternary with the detailed evidence that plant species have responded individualistically to climate change at millennial timescales. Using a fossil-pollen data set of over 700 sites, we review late-Quaternary vegetation history in northern and eastern North America across levels of ecological organization from individual taxa to biomes, and apply the insights gained from this review to critically examine the biome maps generated from the pollen data. Higher-order features of the vegetation (e.g., plant associations, physiognomy) emerge from individualistic responses of plant taxa to climate change, and different representations of vegetation history reveal different aspects of vegetation dynamics. Vegetation distribution and composition were relatively stable during full-glacial times (21‚Ää000‚Äì 17‚Ää000 yr BP) [calendar years] and during the mid- to late Holocene (7000‚Äì500 yr BP), but changed rapidly during the late-glacial period and early Holocene (16‚Ää000‚Äì8‚Ää000 yr BP) and after 500 yr BP. Shifts in plant taxon distributions were characterized by individualistic changes in population abundances and ranges and included large east‚Äìwest shifts in distribution in addition to the northward redistribution of most taxa. Modern associations such as Fagus‚ÄìTsuga and Picea‚ÄìAlnus‚ÄìBetula date to the early Holocene, whereas other associations common to the late-glacial period (e.g., Picea‚ÄìCyperaceae‚ÄìFraxinus‚ÄìOstrya/ Carpinus) no longer exist. Biomes are dynamic entities that have changed in distribution, composition, and structure over time. The late-Pleistocene suite of biomes is distinct from those that grew during the Holocene. The pollen-based biome reconstructions are able to capture the major features of late-Quaternary vegetation but downplay the magnitude and variety of vegetational responses to climate change by (1) limiting apparent land-cover change to ecotones, (2) masking internal variations in biome composition, and (3) obscuring the range shifts and changes in abundance among individual taxa. The compositional and structural differences between full-glacial and recent biomes of the same type are similar to or greater than the spatial heterogeneity in the composition and structure of present-day biomes. This spatial and temporal heterogeneity allows biome maps to accommodate individualistic behavior among species but masks climatically important variations in taxonomic composition as well as structural differences between modern biomes and their ancient counterparts.},

But scholarly practices in the humanities are changing as older forms of communal inquiry are combined with modern research methods enabled by the Internet, accessible computing, data availability, and new media.  Hermeneutica introduces text analysis using computer-assisted interpretive practices. It offers theoretical chapters about text analysis, presents a set of analytical tools (called Voyant) that instantiate the theory, and provides example essays that illustrate the use of these tools. Voyant allows users to integrate interpretation into texts by creating hermeneutica -- small embeddable "toys" that can be woven into essays published online or into such online writing environments as blogs or wikis. The book's companion website, Hermeneutic.ca, offers the example essays with both text and embedded interactive panels. The panels show results and allow readers to experiment with the toys themselves.The use of these analytical tools results in a hybrid essay: an interpretive work embedded with hermeneutical toys that can be explored for technique. The hermeneutica draw on and develop such common interactive analytics as word clouds and complex data journalism interactives. Embedded in scholarly texts, they create a more engaging argument. Moving between tool and text becomes another thread in a dynamic dialogue.},

	abstract = {The ‚Äútype‚Äù DeKalb mounds of northeastern Illinois, USA (42.0¬∞N, ‚àí88.7¬∞W), are formed of basal sand and gravel overlain by rhythmically bedded fines, and weathered sand and gravel. Generally from 2 to 7 m thick, the fines include abundant fossils of ostracodes and uncommon leaves and stems of tundra plants. Rare chironomid head capsules, pillclam shells, and aquatic plant macrofossils also have been observed.

Radiocarbon ages on the tundra plant fossils from the ‚Äútype‚Äù region range from 20,420 to 18,560 cal yr BP. Comparison of radiocarbon ages of terrestrial plants from type area ice-walled lake plains and adjacent kettle basins indicate that the topographic inversion to ice-free conditions occurred from 18,560 and 16,650 cal yr BP. Outside the ‚Äútype‚Äù area, the oldest reliable age of tundra plant fossils in DeKalb mound sediment is 21,680 cal yr BP; the mound occurs on the northern arm of the Ransom Moraine (‚àí88.5436¬∞W, 41.5028¬∞N). The youngest age, 16,250 cal yr BP, is associated with a mound on the Deerfield Moraine (‚àí87.9102¬∞W, 42.4260¬∞N) located about 9 km east of Lake Michigan. The chronology of individual successions indicates the lakes persisted on the periglacial landscape for about 300 to 1500 yr.},

	abstract = {This research reconstructs a 2000-year vegetation history of the forest tension zone, an ecotone between the mixed coniferous-deciduous (Laurentian) forest and the eastern broadleaf forest, in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, USA. Different forest communities relative to the ecotone are represented by pollen analysis of sediment cores from three lakes: Hicks Lake (75 km north of the ecotone), Cowden Lake (within), and Morrison Lake (55 km to the south). Pollen data delineate the presence of the ecotone during the past 2,000 years. North-south shifts in the location of the ecotone occurred along with changes in tree dominance in response to two climatic oscillations over the past two millennia: the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) from 1000 to 700 cal yr BP and the Little Ice Age (LIA), 500-150 cal yr BP. During the MWP, Thuja increased in the forest around the northern lake, Quercus replaced Fagus in the forest around the central lake, and Quercus forest succeeded a Fagus-Acer forest near the southern lake. Abrupt shifts in the abundance of several important taxa were associated with the LIA cooling, beginning at 500 cal yr BP. Thuja declined from 40\% to just under 20\% as Pinus and Tsuga increased around the northern lake; Quercus declined whereas Pinus, Tsuga, and Fagus expanded in the vicinity of the central lake; and Fagus and Acer became more prevalent near the southern lake. This research demonstrates the sensitivity of forest communities to late Holocene climate change as well as documents how species dominance changed in response to small variations in temperature (1-2¬∞ C) and precipitation over the last 2000 years. We can expect that this and similar systems will respond greatly to the temperature and precipitation fluctuations projected for the Great Lakes Region.},

Presented are pollen and plant macrofossil data from two lakes in North Dakota and discussion of these results in the context of published paleoenvironmental and archaeological data for the region. Aridity has characterized the regional climate since deglaciation. From 12,000 to 10,000 14C yr B.P., this aridity was counter-balanced by glacial meltwater saturating much of the landscape, which supported a vegetation of white spruce parkland. The regional water table lowered after 10,000 14C yr B.P As some lakes went dry or became saline others received ground-water input, thereby creating scattered ‚Äúoases‚Äù in a deciduous parkland, which would have attracted prehistoric people and game alike. Grassland became widespread by 9000 14C yr B.P. Alternating arid and moist intervals characterized the mid-Holocene Altithermal, but some oases existed in the region. This paper supports the hypothesis proposed by some archaeologists for the persistence of human occupation of the northern Plains during the Altithermal except, perhaps, during the severest droughts.},

	abstract = {Processes and rates of ecosystem development can be reconstructed using lacustrine sedimentary sequences, but this approach often requires records that contain the start of primary succession. Most lakes in the upper Midwestern U.S. were formed by glaciers at the end of the last Ice Age approximately 11,700¬†cal¬†yr¬†BP. Devils Lake, Wisconsin is a rare example of a lake from this region whose sediments extend into the Pleistocene and may include the Last Glacial Maximum. Sediment magnetic, geochemical, pollen, and charcoal records were generated from a 10¬†m core whose basal sediments may be 28,000 years old. Together with a previously published pollen record, these proxies combine to reveal a history of long-term climatic, vegetative and geologic change during the late Pleistocene to Holocene. We identify six sedimentary units that indicate a series of consecutive events rather than a predictable trajectory of ecosystem development at the site. Productivity in the lake was low during the late Pleistocene and increased during the Holocene, as reflected by the sediment lithology, which shows a sudden shift from glacial vivianite-rich and organic-poor clastic-dominated sediments to Holocene diatomaceous sapropels. Several important processes initiated around 17,000¬†cal¬†yr¬†BP, including the onset of organic matter accumulation and fire in the terrestrial ecosystem. However, the post-glacial landscape was not devoid of vegetation because pollen assemblages indicate that terrestrial vegetation, likely a spruce tundra, survived near the site. A switch to a hardwood forest period during the Holocene also led to a change in the fire regime, with increased frequency of burning. Aquatic ecosystem productivity lagged terrestrial ecosystem productivity throughout the record. Nutrient cycling (as recorded by sedimentary Œ¥15N) was variable but not directional, and appeared to be correlated with climate conditions early in the record, and terrestrial ecosystem processes later in the record. Throughout the Holocene magnetic mineral concentration decreased as productivity increased, and the source of magnetic material shifted from almost exclusively lithogenic to approximately 50\% derived from soil or biogenic sources. Magnetic grain size, Ambrosia pollen percentages, and charcoal concentration increased and Œ¥15N decreased in the most recent part of the record, due to anthropogenic influence in the region including agricultural activities.},

Here we present a large-scale quantitative analysis of trial transcripts from the Old Bailey that reveal a major transition in the nature of this defining moment. By coarse-graining the spoken word testimony into synonym sets and dividing the trials based on indictment, we demonstrate the emergence of semantically distinct violent and nonviolent trial genres. We show that although in the late 18th century the semantic content of trials for violent offenses is functionally indistinguishable from that for nonviolent ones, a long-term, secular trend drives the system toward increasingly clear distinctions between violent and nonviolent acts. We separate this process into the shifting patterns that drive it, determine the relative effects of bureaucratic change and broader cultural shifts, and identify the synonym sets most responsible for the eventual genre distinguishability. This work provides a new window onto the cultural and institutional changes that accompany the monopolization of violence by the state, described in qualitative historical analysis as the civilizing process.},

Historical GIS introduces the basic concepts and tools underpinning GIS technology, describing and critically assessing the visualisation, analytical and e-science methodologies that it enables and examining key scholarship where GIS has been used to enhance research debates.

	shorttitle = {Extinction},
	abstract = {Some thousands of years ago, the world was home to an immense variety of large mammals. From wooly mammoths and saber-toothed tigers to giant ground sloths and armadillos the size of automobiles, these spectacular creatures roamed freely. Then human beings arrived. Devouring their way down the food chain as they spread across the planet, they began a process of voracious extinction that has continued to the present.Headlines today are made by the existential threat confronting remaining large animals such as rhinos and pandas. But the devastation summoned by humans extends to humbler realms of creatures including beetles, bats and butterflies. Researchers generally agree that the current extinction rate is nothing short of catastrophic. Currently the earth is losing about a hundred species every day.This relentless extinction, Ashley Dawson contends in a primer that combines vast scope with elegant precision, is the product of a global attack on the commons, the great trove of air, water, plants and creatures, as well as collectively created cultural forms such as language, that have been regarded traditionally as the inheritance of humanity as a whole.This attack has its genesis in the need for capital to expand relentlessly into all spheres of life. Extinction, Dawson argues, cannot be understood in isolation from a critique of our economic system. To achieve this we need to transgress the boundaries between science, environmentalism and radical politics. Extinction: A Radical History performs this task with both brio and brilliance.},

	abstract = {Changes in climate affected human societies throughout the last millennium. While European cold periods in the 17th and 18th century have been assessed in detail, earlier cold periods received much less attention due to sparse information available. New evidence from proxy archives, historical documentary sources and climate model simulations permit us to provide an interdisciplinary, systematic assessment of an exceptionally cold period in the 15th century. Our assessment includes the role of internal, unforced climate variability and external forcing in shaping extreme climatic conditions and the impacts on and responses of the medieval society in north-western and central Europe.Climate reconstructions from a multitude of natural and anthropogenic archives indicate that the 1430s were the coldest decade in north-western and central Europe in the 15th century. This decade is characterised by cold winters and average to warm summers resulting in a strong seasonal cycle in temperature. Results from comprehensive climate models indicate consistently that these conditions occurred by chance due to the partly chaotic internal variability within the climate system. External forcing like volcanic eruptions tends to reduce simulated temperature seasonality and cannot explain the reconstructions. The strong seasonal cycle in temperature reduced food production and led to increasing food prices, a subsistence crisis and a famine in parts of Europe. Societies were not prepared to cope with failing markets and interrupted trade routes. In response to the crisis, authorities implemented numerous measures of supply policy and adaptation such as the installation of grain storage capacities to be prepared for future food production shortfalls.},

In place of the traditionally selective literary canon of a few hundred texts, Moretti offers charts, maps and time lines, developing the idea of ‚Äúdistant reading‚Äù into a full-blown experiment in literary historiography, in which the canon disappears into the larger literary system. Charting entire genres‚Äîthe epistolary, the gothic, and the historical novel‚Äîas well as the literary output of countries such as Japan, Italy, Spain, and Nigeria, he shows how literary history looks significantly different from what is commonly supposed and how the concept of aesthetic form can be radically redefined.},

Jockers introduces readers to large-scale literary computing and the revolutionary potential of macroanalysis--a new approach to the study of the literary record designed for probing the digital-textual world as it exists today, in digital form and in large quantities. Using computational analysis to retrieve key words, phrases, and linguistic patterns across thousands of texts in digital libraries, researchers can draw conclusions based on quantifiable evidence regarding how literary trends are employed over time, across periods, within regions, or within demographic groups, as well as how cultural, historical, and societal linkages may bind individual authors, texts, and genres into an aggregate literary culture.¬†Moving beyond the limitations of literary interpretation based on the "close-reading" of individual works, Jockers describes how this new method of studying large collections of digital material can help us to better understand and contextualize the individual works within those collections.},

	abstract = {‚ÄúWhen Species Meet is a breathtaking meditation on the intersection between humankind and dog, philosophy and science, and macro and micro cultures.‚Äù ‚ÄîCameron Woo, Publisher of Bark magazine¬†In 2006, about 69 million U.S. households had pets, giving homes to around 73.9 million dogs, 90.5 million cats, and 16.6 million birds, and spending over \$38 billion dollars on companion animals. As never before in history, our pets are truly members of the family. But the notion of ‚Äúcompanion¬† species‚Äù‚Äîknotted from human beings, animals and other organisms, landscapes, and technologies‚Äîincludes much more than ‚Äúcompanion animals.‚Äù¬†In When Species Meet, Donna J. Haraway digs into this larger phenomenon to contemplate the interactions of humans with many kinds of critters, especially with those called domestic. At the heart of the book are her experiences in agility training with her dogs Cayenne and Roland, but Haraway‚Äôs vision here also encompasses wolves, chickens, cats, baboons, sheep, microorganisms, and whales wearing video cameras. From designer pets to lab animals to trained therapy dogs, she deftly explores philosophical, cultural, and biological aspects of animal-human encounters.¬†In this deeply personal yet intellectually groundbreaking work, Haraway develops the idea of companion species, those who meet and break bread together but not without some indigestion. ‚ÄúA great deal is at stake in such meetings,‚Äù she writes, ‚Äúand outcomes are not guaranteed.¬† There is no assured happy or unhappy ending‚Äîsocially, ecologically, or scientifically. There is only the chance for getting on together with some grace.‚Äù¬†Ultimately, she finds that respect, curiosity, and knowledge spring from animal-human associations and work powerfully against ideas about human exceptionalism.¬†One of the founders of the posthumanities, Donna J. Haraway is professor in the History of Consciousness Department at the University of California, Santa   Cruz. Author of many books and widely read essays, including The Companion Species Manifesto: Dogs, People, and Significant Otherness and the now-classic essay ‚ÄúThe Cyborg Manifesto,‚Äù she received the J. D. Bernal Prize in 2000, a lifetime achievement award from the Society for Social Studies in Science.},

Flach provides case studies of increasing complexity and variety with well-chosen examples and illustrations throughout. He covers a wide range of logical, geometric and statistical models and state-of-the-art topics such as matrix factorisation and ROC analysis. Particular attention is paid to the central role played by features. The use of established terminology is balanced with the introduction of new and useful concepts, and summaries of relevant background material are provided with pointers for revision if necessary. These features ensure Machine Learning will set a new standard as an introductory textbook.},

It is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It is often used as a scripting language because of its forgiving syntax and compatibility with a wide variety of different eco-systems. Its flexible syntax enables developers to write short scripts while at the same time, they can use object-oriented concepts to develop very large projects.Python GUI Programming Cookbook follows a task-based approach to help you create beautiful and very effective GUIs with the least amount of code necessary. This book uses the simplest programming style, using the fewest lines of code to create a GUI in Python, and then advances to using object-oriented programming in later chapters. If you are new to object-oriented programming (OOP), this book will teach you how to take advantage of the OOP coding style in the context of creating GUIs written in Python.Throughout the book, you will develop an entire GUI application, building recipe upon recipe, connecting the GUI to a database. In the later chapters, you will explore additional Python GUI frameworks, using best practices. You will also learn how to use threading to ensure your GUI doesn't go unresponsive.By the end of the book, you will be an expert in Python GUI programming to develop a common set of GUI applications.Style and approachEvery recipe in this programming cookbook solves a problem you might encounter in your programming career. At the same time, most of the recipes build on each other to create an entire, real-life GUI application.},

Covering projected changes in climate and hydrology, this collection of studies first estimates the potential impacts of climate change on human health, natural ecosystems, water resources, energy, and infrastructure in the city of Chicago and the surrounding Great Lakes region. A consistent set of future climate projections have been used as the basis for each analysis, which together provide a vivid impression of the consequences likely to result under the SRES higher (A1FI) as compared to the lower (B1) emission scenarios. These findings highlight the importance of the next set of analyses, which focus on quantifying Chicago's greenhouse gas emissions and prioritizing emissions reduction and adaptation options in light of the projected impacts. Together, these analyses form the basis for the City of Chicago's Climate Action Plan, the first such plan to be based on a thorough climate change impact assessment exploring the implications of a range of future climate scenarios. Although focused on Chicago and the Great Lakes region, the methods described here are generally applicable across North America and many other parts of the world, serving as a pattern for future regional assessments to directly inform adaptation and mitigation policy at the local to regional scale.},

By tracing the connections between scientists and local fishermen underlying the research on floodplain lakes presented in "The Lake as a Microcosm," this essay shows how the birth of ecology was tied to local knowledge and the local politics of environmental transformation. Forbes and the other scientists of the Illinois Natural History Survey relied on fishermen for manual labor, expertise in catching fish, and knowledge of the natural history of the fishes. As Forbes and his colleagues worked in close contact with fishermen, they also adopted many of their political concerns over the privatization of the floodplain and became politically active in supporting their interests. The close connection between scientists and local knowledge forced the ecologists to reframe the boundaries of ecology as objective or political, pure or applied, local or scientific.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
Indigenous farmers in Pre-Columbian North America have frequently been characterized as shifting cultivators whose agricultural productivity was marginal and unstable, and whose actions were damaging to the environment. In this article I challenge this assessment. The presence of large tracts of highly productive soils in eastern and central North America suggests that farmers here would not have engaged in shifting cultivation, but rather practiced permanent, intensive cropping. The lack of plows, often cited as an impediment for Native American farmers was in fact an advantage. Agricultural systems with hand tools cause less destruction of soil organic matter and reduce soil erosion; they enable sustained crop yields over longer periods of time compared to plow-based systems. Indigenous farmers in North America also grew a highly productive cereal grain, maize, uniquely suited to no-plow conditions. Maize yields of 25 to 50 bu/acre were both realistic and stable, allowing indigenous farmers to support modest populations for extended periods of time. This combination of access to fertile soils, a cropping system that preserved soils, and a high-yielding grain crop enabled agriculture that was largely productive, stable, and with limited negative effects on the environment.},

This article compares food yields and other nutrient contributions from the Three Sisters, comprised of interplanted maize, bean and pumpkin, with monocultures of these same crops. The Three Sisters yields more energy (12.25 x 106 kcal/ha) and more protein (349 kg/ha) than any of the crop monocultures or mixtures of monocultures planted to the same area. The Three Sisters supplies 13.42 people/ha/yr. with energy and 15.86 people/ha/yr. with protein. Nutrient contents of the crops are further enhanced by nixtamalization, a traditional processing technique where maize is cooked in a high alkaline solution. This process increases calcium, protein quality, and niacin in maize.},

A traditional open-pollinated white flour corn yielded from 22 to 76¬†bu/acre (1155 to 4127¬†kg/ha); the higher yields were obtained in New York's Lake Plain region with its fertile soils and long growing season. Corn grain yields were also higher at increased plant densities and closer spacing. We argue that these grain yields, which are significantly higher than other scholars have reported, are an accurate reflection of the yield potential of the productive soils of this region. Other researchers have failed to account for the complex and critical ways that soil organic matter and agronomic practices determine corn yields. Our yield estimates are further supported by eyewitness accounts that describe a highly productive agriculture practiced by Iroquoian farmers in the 16th through 18th centuries. Using Land Equivalency Ratios, we also demonstrate that the three crops grown as a polyculture were more productive than monocultures of individual crops. Corn grain yields were little affected by competition from bean and squash, but these two crops yielded much less in the polyculture compared to monocultures. We suggest that the Three Sisters, while widespread, was not universal across Iroquoia.},

	abstract = {Iroquois maize farmers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries produced three to five times more grain per acre than wheat farmers in Europe. The higher productivity of Iroquois agriculture can be attributed to two factors. First, the absence of plows in the western hemisphere allowed Iroquois farmers to maintain high levels of soil organic matter, critical for grain yields. Second, maize has a higher yield potential than wheat because of its C4 photosynthetic pathway and lower protein content. However, tillage alone accounted for a significant portion of the yield advantage of the Iroquois farmers. When the Iroquois were removed from their territories at the end of the eighteenth century, US farmers occupied and plowed these lands. Within fifty years, maize yields in five counties of western New York dropped to less than thirty bushels per acre. They rebounded when US farmers adopted practices that countered the harmful effects of plowing.},

These disturbances are also known to affect the relative abundance of warm-season (C4) and cool-season (C3) grasses in native prairie. Although burning is a commonly used tool, the utility of livestock grazing to manage restored prairie is less understood. We established five monocultures and one mixture of C4 grass species of the eastern tallgrass prairie in southern Wisconsin. To examine their persistence under high-intensity, short-duration summer grazing, we estimated cover of several functional groups and C4 species over a 6-year period (2000 through 2006) in a randomized complete block design. After a 2-year establishment phase (1998‚Äì1999), bison were rotated through paddocks two or three times annually during late June, July, or early August. All C4 grasses declined over time but at different rates depending on the species. Switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum) decreased at the lowest rate, whereas Little bluestem ( Schizachyrium scoparium) cover declined faster than Big bluestem ( Andropogon gerardii), Indiangrass ( Sorghastrum nutans), and Sideoats grama ( Bouteloua curtipendula), whose rates of decline were not significantly different from each other. Succession followed a predictable trajectory with annual grasses initially colonizing interstitial space among C4 grasses, followed by legumes, which ultimately gave way to exotic C3 forage grasses. The focal C4 grasses remained the dominant functional group 8 years postseeding, but recolonization by non-native C3 grasses increased over the study period.},

Precipitation is considered to be a key driver of ecosystem processes in mesic grasslands, and climate models predict changes in the amount and intensity of precipitation under future global change scenarios. Although most experimental rainfall studies decrease precipitation, seasonal rainfall is predicted to increase in the northern Great Plains under climate change. 2. We analysed changes in community composition and structure of upland and lowland native tallgrass prairie in central Kansas, USA, subjected to 19 years of irrigation designed to eliminate moisture stress throughout the growing season. 3. Irrigation had limited effects on species richness in both upland and lowland prairie. Total cover increased significantly and consistently with irrigation in drier uplands and in more mesic lowlands. Abundance of rhizomatous, tall, perennial species as well as C3 forbs increased with irrigation. 4. The strongest response to irrigation came within the dominant functional type, C4 perennial grasses. Panicum virgatum became the dominant species in irrigated lowlands, whereas Andropogon gerardii remained the dominant species in irrigated uplands and in control plots. Overall, irrigation had less effect on community composition and structure than other known drivers of grassland structure and function. 5. In comparison with other studies, our results demonstrate that water addition has less of an impact than fire, grazing or nitrogen addition on composition and dynamics in this mesic grassland. The strongest response to long-term irrigation occurred within the dominant functional type: tall, perennial, rhizomatous, C4 grasses. Thus, functional redundancy will buffer this ecosystem from potential increases in rainfall due to climate change. Finally, our results highlight the limited utility of qualitative functional traits to predict how this mesic grassland will respond to climate change.},

	abstract = {Proxy records and results of a three dimensional climate model show that European summer temperatures roughly a millennium ago were comparable to those of the last 25 years of the 20th century, supporting the existence of a summer "Medieval Warm Period" in Europe. Those two relatively mild periods were separated by a rather cold era, often referred to as the "Little Ice Age". Our modelling results suggest that the warm summer conditions during the early second millennium compared to the climate background state of the 13th‚Äì18th century are due to a large extent to the long term cooling induced by changes in land-use in Europe. During the last 200 years, the effect of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, which was partly levelled off by that of sulphate aerosols, has dominated the climate history over Europe in summer. This induces a clear warming during the last 200 years, allowing summer temperature during the last 25 years to reach back the values simulated for the early second millennium. Volcanic and solar forcing plays a weaker role in this comparison between the last 25 years of the 20th century and the early second millennium. Our hypothesis appears consistent with proxy records but modelling results have to be weighted against the existing uncertainties in the external forcing factors, in particular related to land-use changes, and against the uncertainty of the regional climate sensitivity. Evidence for winter is more equivocal than for summer. The forced response in the model displays a clear temperature maximum at the end of the 20th century. However, the uncertainties are too large to state that this period is the warmest of the past millennium in Europe during winter.},

	abstract = {Future climate change is likely to reduce the floristic diversity of grasslands. Yet the potential consequences of climate-induced plant species losses for the functioning of these ecosystems are poorly understood. We investigated how climate change might alter the functional composition of grasslands for Konza Prairie, a diverse tallgrass prairie in central North America. With species-specific climate envelopes, we show that a reduction in mean annual precipitation would preferentially remove species that are more abundant in the more productive lowland positions at Konza. As such, decreases in precipitation could reduce productivity not only by reducing water availability but by also removing species that inhabit the most productive areas and respond the most to climate variability. In support of this prediction, data on species abundance at Konza over 16 years show that species that are more abundant in lowlands than uplands are preferentially reduced in years with low precipitation. Climate change is likely to also preferentially remove species from particular functional groups and clades. For example, warming is forecast to preferentially remove perennials over annuals as well as Cyperaceae species. Despite these predictions, climate change is unlikely to unilaterally alter the functional composition of the tallgrass prairie flora, as many functional traits such as physiological drought tolerance and maximum photosynthetic rates showed little relationship with climate envelope parameters. In all, although climatic drying would indirectly alter grassland productivity through species loss patterns, the insurance afforded by biodiversity to ecosystem function is likely to be sustained in the face of climate change.},

	abstract = {Spring fires in tallgrass prairie can create environmental conditions conducive to plant growth in the subsequent growing season. Following fires, burned areas can also be attractive to grazing animals such as bison ( Bison bison). Sustained grazing activity within recently burned areas can alter vegetation structure relative to nearby landscape patches that haven't burned recently. In 2007, we collected data on bison grazing activity, vegetation structure, and the growth and reproduction of a perennial forb, Arnoglossum plantagineum, in Oklahoma tallgrass prairie. We compared these variables in landscape patches that had burned in the spring of 2007 to measurements of these variables in adjacent landscape patches that had burned in the spring of 2004 or 2005. Our results demonstrate that bison grazing activity and many vegetation structure variables can differ markedly in landscape patches that differ in their time since fire but are directly adjacent to each other. Las quemas de primavera en la pradera de pastos altos pueden crear condiciones ambientales propicias al crecimiento vegetal en la subsecuente temporada de crecimiento . A ra√≠z de los incendios, las √°reas quemadas tambi√©n pueden ser atractivas para pastoreo de animales como el bisonte ( Bison bison). Actividad de pastoreo sostenida dentro de las √°reas recientemente quemadas puede alterar la estructura de la vegetaci√≥n en relaci√≥n con parches de paisaje cercano que no se han quemado recientemente. En 2007, recogimos datos de actividad de pastoreo del bisonte , estructura de la vegetaci√≥n y el crecimiento y la reproducci√≥n de una hierba perenne, Arnoglossum plantagineum, en la pradera de pastos altos de Oklahoma. Comparamos estas variables en parches de paisaje que hab√≠an quemado en la primavera de 2007, a las medidas de estas variables en parches de paisaje adyacentes que hab√≠an quemado en la primavera de 2004 o 2005. Nuestros resultados demuestran que la actividad de pastoreo del bisonte y muchas variables de estructura de la vegetaci√≥n pueden diferenciar marcadamente en parches de paisaje que difieren en su tiempo desde la quema, estando a la par uno del otro.},

Evidence is reviewed for changes in temperature, drought, and atmospheric circulation over this timescale. Methods for reconstructing past climate from proxy data are reviewed and comparisons with the results of climate modeling studies are provided. The assessment provided affirms the role of natural (solar and volcanic) radiative forcing in past changes in large-scale mean temperature changes and in dynamical modes of climate variability such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Ni√±o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influencing large-scale climate. At hemispheric scales, late twentieth century warmth appears unprecedented in the context of at least the past 2000 years. This anomalous warmth can only be explained by modern anthropogenic forcing.},

The behavior of these animals is important as it directs the spatial effects of grazing. To the degree that temperature drives spatial components of foraging, understanding how changes in climate alter grazing behavior will provide guidance for the conservation of ecosystem goods and services. We determined the behavioral response of native bison ( Bison bison) and introduced cattle ( Bos taurus) to temperature in tallgrass prairie within the Great Plains, USA. We described the thermal environment by measuring operative temperature (the temperature perceived by animals) through space and time. Site selection preferences of ungulates were quantified using resource selection functions. Woody vegetation in tallgrass prairie provided a cooler thermal environment for large ungulates, decreasing operative temperature up to 16 ¬∞C in the heat of the summer. Cattle began to seek thermal refugia at lower air temperatures (24 ¬∞C) by selecting areas closer to woody vegetation and water sources. Bison, however, sought refugia within wooded areas at higher air temperatures (36 ¬∞C), which occurred much less frequently. Both species became more attracted to riparian areas as air temperature increased, with preferences increasing tenfold during the hottest periods. As predicted warming occurs across the Great Plains and other grasslands, grazing behavior and subsequent grazing effects will be altered. Riparian areas, particularly those with both water and woody vegetation, will receive greater utilization and selection by large ungulates. The use of native grazers for conservation or livestock production may mitigate negative effects caused by increased temperatures.},

We maximized reconstruction length by using long but low-resolution pollen records and applied a three-tier calibration scheme for this purpose. The tree-ring-based reconstruction was calibrated against instrumental annual average temperatures on annual and decadal scale, it was then reduced to a lower resolution, and was used as a calibration target for the pollen-based reconstruction. Before the late-19th to the early-21st century, there are three prominent low-frequency periods in our extended reconstruction starting at 480 CE, notably the Dark Ages cool period (about 500‚Äì700 CE) and Little Ice Age (about 1200‚Äì1900 CE), and the warmer medieval climate anomaly (MCA; about 750‚Äì1100 CE). The 9th and the 11th century are the warmest centuries and they constitute the core of the MCA in our reconstruction, a period characterized by centennial-scale aridity in the North American West. These two warm peaks are slightly warmer than the baseline period (1904‚Äì1980), but nevertheless much cooler than temperate North American temperatures during the early-21st century.},

	abstract = {Long-term, slow ecological processes such as changes in plant community structure and composition strongly regulate ecosystem responses to climate change. Shifts in plant community are expected in chronically altered environments under warming. However, experimental evidence for long-term shifts and the associated mechanisms is still scarce in temperate grasslands., Here, we explore the long-term responses of a prairie plant community to 14-year (2000-2013) manipulations of climate warming and clipping in Oklahoma, USA. Infrared heaters were used to elevate soil temperature by about 2 ¬∞C all year round, and annual clipping was applied to mimic hay harvest., Community composition was resistant to experimental warming in the first seven years, but started to show responses starting from the eighth year; clipping consistently affected community composition over the years. Compositional change under long-term warming was mainly due to one invasive species and three dominant species. The negative correlations in relative abundance between the invasive species and the dominant species suggest interspecific competition. Community structure (i.e. richness, evenness and diversity) had no overall response to experimental warming. However, in 2007, the extreme wet year, warming reduced species richness by 30\%. Clipping promoted species richness by 10\% on average over the 14 years but decreased community evenness. Warming did not interact with clipping in influencing the plant community variables., Synthesis. Our study provides experimental evidence for long-term shifts in plant community composition due to warming and revealed novel mechanisms (i.e. species invasion and associated biotic interactions) underlying the long-term shift. The results also suggest that climate extremes may elicit or advance community responses to climate warming. The findings highlight that long-term climate change experiments are essential to reveal potential shifts in community composition.},

We determined how interannual variation in the timing and magnitude of precipitation affected the weight gain of free-roaming bison in their first and second year. Bison weights were analyzed for 14 years for Konza Prairie, Kansas, and 12 years for Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, Oklahoma. Greater late-summer precipitation increased bison weight gain. For every 100 mm precipitation, weight gain increased 6.4‚Äì15.3 kg depending on age classes and site. In contrast, greater midsummer precipitation decreased weight gain. For every additional 100 mm precipitation, weight decreased 9.7‚Äì17.3 kg depending on age class and site. The decreased weight gain of bison with greater midsummer precipitation was associated with increased grass stem production during the period for each of three dominant grasses at Konza Prairie. Although greater stem production increases the quantity of aboveground biomass, it should decrease the overall nutritional quality of biomass to grazers, which would reduce weight gain. With offsetting effects of mid- and late-summer precipitation on weight gain, these results show that predicting the effects of climate change on grazers must incorporate both the timing and magnitude of changes in precipitation and their effects on both the quantity and quality of biomass.},

However, little is known about how plant community structure regulates responses of soil respiration to climate change. Here, we used a 13-year field warming experiment to explore the mechanisms underlying plant community regulation on feedbacks of soil respiration to climate change in a tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma, USA. Infrared heaters were used to elevate temperature about 2 ¬∞C since November 1999. Annual clipping was used to mimic hay harvest. Our results showed that experimental warming significantly increased soil respiration approximately from 10\% in the first 7 years (2000-2006) to 30\% in the next 6 years (2007-2012). The two-stage warming stimulation of soil respiration was closely related to warming-induced increases in ecosystem production over the years. Moreover, we found that across the 13 years, warming-induced increases in soil respiration were positively affected by the proportion of aboveground net primary production ( ANPP) contributed by C3 forbs. Functional composition of the plant community regulated warming-induced increases in soil respiration through the quantity and quality of organic matter inputs to soil and the amount of photosynthetic carbon (C) allocated belowground. Clipping, the interaction of clipping with warming, and warming-induced changes in soil temperature and moisture all had little effect on soil respiration over the years (all P {\textgreater} 0.05). Our results suggest that climate warming may drive an increase in soil respiration through altering composition of plant communities in grassland ecosystems.},

Are the primary tallgrass prairies of the Flint Hills reflective of a history of continuous fire occurrence? Did fire frequency, severity, size and seasonality change in connection with changes in land use? Has fire occurrence been related to drought conditions? Location: Edges of Cross Timbers forest stands at the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve (TGPP) in the Flint Hills of Osage County, Oklahoma, USA. Methods: Cross-sections of 76 Quercus stellata were collected from Cross Timbers stands at or near the grassland edge in the TGPP. Dendrochronological methods were used to identify years of formation for tree rings and fire scars. Superposed epoch analysis was used to evaluate the effect of drought conditions on fire occurrence. Results: Fires were recorded in 46.6\% of the years between 1729 and 2005. In 41 cross-sections at one site, the mean fire interval between 1759 and 2003 was 2.59 years, with fire interval decreasing from a mean fire interval of 3.76 years in the early part of the record to 2.13 years in modern times. No extended periods without fire were recorded in the study area. Drought conditions had no significant effect on fire occurrence. Conclusions: In contrast with many fire-prone landscapes worldwide, the prairies of the Flint Hills have experienced no recent fire suppression or exclusion. Changes in fire frequency mark transitions in land use, primarily from being traditionally used by Native Americans to being managed for cattle production.},

Following fires, burned areas can also be attractive to grazing animals such as bison ( Bison bison). Sustained grazing activity within recently burned areas can alter vegetation structure relative to nearby landscape patches that haven't burned recently. In 2007, we collected data on bison grazing activity, vegetation structure, and the growth and reproduction of a perennial forb, Arnoglossum plantagineum, in Oklahoma tallgrass prairie. We compared these variables in landscape patches that had burned in the spring of 2007 to measurements of these variables in adjacent landscape patches that had burned in the spring of 2004 or 2005. Our results demonstrate that bison grazing activity and many vegetation structure variables can differ markedly in landscape patches that differ in their time since fire but are directly adjacent to each other.

En 2007, recogimos datos de actividad de pastoreo del bisonte , estructura de la vegetaci√≥n y el crecimiento y la reproducci√≥n de una hierba perenne, Arnoglossum plantagineum, en la pradera de pastos altos de Oklahoma. Comparamos estas variables en parches de paisaje que hab√≠an quemado en la primavera de 2007, a las medidas de estas variables en parches de paisaje adyacentes que hab√≠an quemado en la primavera de 2004 o 2005. Nuestros resultados demuestran que la actividad de pastoreo del bisonte y muchas variables de estructura de la vegetaci√≥n pueden diferenciar marcadamente en parches de paisaje que difieren en su tiempo desde la quema, estando a la par uno del otro.},

Scientists initially attempted to explain the anomaly‚Äîgrasses where trees should have been‚Äîby offering a myriad of potential climate factors and physiographic differences. Quantification of the climate conditions that many identified as crucial to the prairie's existence was possible because of newly available 100-year climate records, and this study identified the thresholds of four conditions that define the boundaries of the prairie. The prairie experienced {\textgreater}90\% more severe drought years than did the forested areas north and south. A second factor considered to sustain the prairie was frequent dry seasons. Fire was a third key to the prairie's presence‚Äîfires destroyed forests but grasses survived and were enhanced by prairie fires. Lightning, in addition to fires set by Native Americans, was a key factor behind the region's high frequency of prairie fires. West of the prairie was a short grass prairie, and the two prairies were separated by differences in warm-season evapotranspiration values. The climatic explanation for the tall grass prairie includes four climate extremes‚Äîmore severe level droughts than north or south of the prairie, frequent very dry cold seasons, many more fires triggered by lightning, and more frequent low evapotranspiration rates in the prairie's west.},

The utilization of burned areas by grazing animals establishes the fire‚Äìgrazing interaction, but the preference for recently burned areas relative to other influences (water, topography, etc.) is unknown. In this study, we determine the strength of the fire‚Äìgrazing interaction by quantifying the influence of fire on ungulate site selection. We compare the preference for recently burned patches relative to the influence of other environmental factors that contribute to site selection; compare that preference between native and introduced ungulates; test relationships between area burned and herbivore preference; and determine forage quality and quantity as mechanisms of site selection. We used two large ungulate species at two grassland locations within the southern Great Plains, USA. At each location, spatially distinct patches were burned within larger areas through time, allowing animals to select among burned and unburned areas. Using fine scale ungulate location data, we estimated resource selection functions to examine environmental factors in site selection. Ungulates preferred recently burned areas and avoided areas with greater time since fire, regardless of the size of landscape, herbivore species, or proportion of area burned. Forage quality was inversely related to time since fire, while forage quantity was positively related. We show that fire is an important component of large ungulate behavior with a strong influence on site selection that drives the fire‚Äìgrazing interaction. This interaction is an ecosystem process that supersedes fire and grazing as separate factors, shaping grassland landscapes. Inclusion of the fire‚Äìgrazing interaction into ecological studies and conservation practices of fire-prone systems will aid in better understanding and managing these systems.},

	abstract = {In tallgrass prairie, disturbances such as grazing and fire can generate patchiness across the landscape, contributing to a shifting mosaic that presumably enhances biodiversity. Grassland birds evolved within the context of this shifting mosaic, with some species restricted to one or two patch types created under spatially and temporally distinct disturbance regimes. Thus, management-driven reductions in heterogeneity may be partly responsible for declines in numbers of grassland birds. We experimentally altered spatial heterogeneity of vegetation structure within a tallgrass prairie by varying the spatial and temporal extent of fire and by allowing grazing animals to move freely among burned and unburned patches (patch treatment). We contrasted this disturbance regime with traditional agricultural management of the region that promotes homogeneity (traditional treatment). We monitored grassland bird abundance during the breeding seasons of 2001‚Äì2003 to determine the influence of altered spatial heterogeneity on the grassland bird community. Focal disturbances of patch burning and grazing that shifted through the landscape over several years resulted in a more heterogeneous pattern of vegetation than uniform application of fire and grazing. Greater spatial heterogeneity in vegetation provided greater variability in the grassland bird community. Some bird species occurred in greatest abundance within focally disturbed patches, while others occurred in relatively undisturbed patches in our patch treatment. Henslow's Sparrow, a declining species, occurred only within the patch treatment. Upland Sandpiper and some other species were more abundant on recently disturbed patches within the same treatment. The patch burn treatment created the entire gradient of vegetation structure required to maintain a suite of grassland bird species that differ in habitat preferences. Our study demonstrated that increasing spatial and temporal heterogeneity of disturbance in grasslands increases variability in vegetation structure that results in greater variability at higher trophic levels. Thus, management that creates a shifting mosaic using spatially and temporally discrete disturbances in grasslands can be a useful tool in conservation. In the case of North American tallgrass prairie, discrete fires that capitalize on preferential grazing behavior of large ungulates promote a shifting mosaic of habitat types that maintain biodiversity and agricultural productivity.},

RET is representative of the prairie-forest ecotone, containing native tallgrass prairie and oak-hickory forest, but unique in having tracts of replanted prairie, seeded in 1957, that have undergone long-term restoration treatments: burned, grazed, mowed, or untreated. A land-use history database for RET was compiled using a geographic information system to integrate historic and contemporary sources of information. Restoration management on the reseeded prairie has had a profound effect on forest development: mowing or burning precluded forest establishment ({\textless}3\% forest cover), whereas portions of untreated or grazed areas became heavily forested ({\textgreater}97\% forest cover). Forest colonization depends upon biotic and edaphic conditions at the time restoration was initiated: for areas replanted to prairie and managed by grazing, forestation was 6\% on land in cultivation prior to replanting, 20\% on former pastureland, and 98\% on land deforested just before replanting. Patterns of forest colonization were also significantly associated with three landscape positions: near existing forest, along water courses, and along ridge tops. Additionally, land-use history analyses showed that the presence of various prairie and forest species resulted from persistence and not from colonization following restoration. Because of the lasting imprint of historic land use on the landscape, our results indicate that it is essential that restoration studies be evaluated within a site-specific historical context.},

We quantified climate dynamics, trends in plant growth, and growth-climate relationships across the tundra shrublands and Cajander larch ( Larix cajanderi Mayr.) woodlands of the Kolyma river basin (657 000 km2) in northeastern Siberia using satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation indices ( NDVI), tree ring-width measurements, and climate data. Mean summer temperatures ( T s) increased 1.0 ¬∞C from 1938 to 2009, though there was no trend ( P {\textgreater} 0.05) in growing year precipitation or climate moisture index ( CMI gy). Mean summer NDVI ( NDVIs) increased significantly from 1982 to 2010 across 20\% of the watershed, primarily in cold, shrub-dominated areas. NDVIs positively correlated ( P {\textless} 0.05) with T s across 56\% of the watershed ( r = 0.52 ¬± 0.09, mean ¬± SD), principally in cold areas, and with CMI gy across 9\% of the watershed ( r = 0.45 ¬± 0.06), largely in warm areas. Larch ring-width measurements from nine sites revealed that year-to-year (i.e., high-frequency) variation in growth positively correlated ( P {\textless} 0.05) with June temperature ( r = 0.40) and prior summer CMI ( r = 0.40) from 1938 to 2007. An unexplained multi-decadal (i.e., low-frequency) decline in annual basal area increment ( BAI) occurred following the mid-20th century, but over the NDVI record there was no trend in mean BAI ( P {\textgreater} 0.05), which significantly correlated with NDVIs ( r = 0.44, P {\textless} 0.05, 1982-2007). Both satellite and tree-ring analyses indicated that plant growth was constrained by both low temperatures and limited moisture availability and, furthermore, that warming enhanced growth. Impacts of future climatic change on forests near treeline in Arctic Russia will likely be influenced by shifts in both temperature and moisture, which implies that projections of future forest distribution and productivity in this area should take into account the interactions of energy and moisture limitations.},

What are the principal driving agents responsible for their present-day composition and distribution? Do the palaeoecological data provide evidence for feedbacks between climate, fire and anthropogenic activities? In this study, the temporal dynamics of grassland, savanna and forest in the summer rainfall region of northern South Africa were reconstructed for the last {\textasciitilde}6500 years. Palaeoecological techniques used include analyses of fossil pollen, charcoal and stable isotopes. Data from two sites located at the present-day grassland-savanna ecotone in Mpumalanga province of South Africa are reported. Results indicate that a mosaic of grassland, savanna and Podocarpus forest occupied the landscape throughout the late Holocene, with grassland and forest dominating higher altitudes, and savanna and forest lower altitudes. Podocarpus forest retreated and grass-dominated vegetation expanded its range around 1800 cal. yr BP at the lower altitude site (Lowveld) and 600 cal. yr BP at the higher altitude site (Highveld), representing a change from a stable state forest savanna/grassland mosaic to an increasingly grass-dominated system. Climatic stress, changes in fire regime and anthropogenic impact led to the vegetation transitions recorded, and resulted in changes in water and nutrient cycles. In an increasingly warm world, with fluctuating water availability and heightened anthropogenic use of natural resources, the future of grass-dominated ecosystems appears far from stable.},

	abstract = {Question: As anthropogenic change pushes ecosystems towards historically novel states, understanding how landscape disturbances interact with climate variability becomes increasingly important. We reconstructed the Holocene vegetation and fire history of a small watershed to investigate the linkages among disturbance regimes, biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem structure. Specifically we asked: (i) how do compositional and structural changes in forest ecosystems modify fire regimes; and (ii) how do changes in fuel type and fire regimes impact biogeochemical cycling? Location: Comstock Lake, Wisconsin, USA, a small kettle lake at the modern prairie-forest ecotone in the Great Lakes Region of North America. Methods: We analysed a lacustrine sediment core from Comstock Lake, Wisconsin, for paleoecological proxies including charcoal quantity and morphotype, pollen composition, magnetic susceptibility, organic matter concentration and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. These paleoecological variables were used to reconstruct climate-mediated shifts in vegetation, fire disturbance and biogeochemical cycling during the last 13¬†200¬†calendar years before present (cal yr BP). Results: Forest composition in the landscape surrounding Comstock Lake varied among coniferous forest, deciduous forest and savanna over the Holocene. Independent of the vegetation changes, five distinct fire regimes were identified, ranging from frequent, low-intensity surface fires to infrequent, high-intensity crown fires. The main feature of our vegetation reconstruction is a shift from Pinus to Quercus forest that occurred between 10¬†000 and 11¬†000¬†cal¬†yr BP. However, changes in fuel source and forest structure were apparently more important than shifts of species composition in determining fire regimes. We observed an inverse relationship between non-arboreal fuel sources and biomass burning throughout all five fire regimes. The biogeochemical consequences of fires were apparent during some, but not all regime transitions. Generally, the sediments were composed of relatively small clastic inputs from the catchment and mostly autochthonous organic sources. Conclusion: The location of Comstock Lake on the prairie-forest boundary meant that regional climate signals during the Holocene were filtered through vegetation. Both compositional changes in dominant tree taxa and structural changes in canopy openness influenced fire regimes. ¬© 2014 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

Comparisons of observations with simulations from an energy balance climate model indicate that as much as 41 to 64\% of preanthropogenic (pre-1850) decadal-scale temperature variations was due to changes in solar irradiance and volcanism. Removal of the forced response from reconstructed temperature time series yields residuals that show similar variability to those of control runs of coupled models, thereby lending support to the models' value as estimates of low-frequency variability in the climate system. Removal of all forcing except greenhouse gases from the ‚àº1000-year time series results in a residual with a very large late-20th-century warming that closely agrees with the response predicted from greenhouse gas forcing. The combination of a unique level of temperature increase in the late 20th century and improved constraints on the role of natural variability provides further evidence that the greenhouse effect has already established itself above the level of natural variability in the climate system. A 21st-century global warming projection far exceeds the natural variability of the past 1000 years and is greater than the best estimate of global temperature change for the last interglacial.},

	abstract = {Aim Climatic conditions exert a strong control on the geographic distribution of many woodland-to-grassland transition zones (or 'tree lines'). Because woody plants have, in general, a weaker cold tolerance than herbaceous vegetation, their altitudinal or latitudinal limits are strongly controlled by cold sensitivity. While temperature controls on the dynamics of woodland-grassland ecotones are relatively well established, the ability of woody plants to modify their microclimate and to create habitat for seedling establishment and growth may involve a variety of processes that are still not completely understood. Here we investigate feedbacks between vegetation and microclimatic conditions in the proximity to woodland-grassland ecotones. Location We concentrate on arctic and alpine tree lines, the transition between mangrove forests and salt marshes in coastal ecosystems, and the shift from shrubland to grassland along temperature gradients in arid landscapes. Methods We review the major abiotic and biotic mechanisms underlying the ability of woody plants to alter the nocturnal microclimate by increasing the temperatures they are exposed to. Results We find that in many arctic, alpine, desert and coastal landscapes the presence of trees or shrubs causes nocturnal warming thereby favouring the establishment and survival of woody plants. Main conclusion Because of this feedback, trees and shrubs may establish in areas that would be otherwise unsuitable for their survival. Thus, in grassland-woodland transition zones both vegetation covers may be (alternative) stable states of the landscape, thereby affecting the way tree lines may migrate in response to regional and global climate change.},

	abstract = {Ecotones are transition zones that form, in forests, where distinct forest types meet across a climatic gradient. In mountains, ecotones are compressed and act as potential harbingers of species shifts that accompany climate change. As the climate warms in New England, USA, high-elevation boreal forests are expected to recede upslope, with northern hardwood species moving up behind. Yet recent empirical studies present conflicting findings on this dynamic, reporting both rapid upward ecotonal shifts and concurrent increases in boreal species within the region. These discrepancies may result from the limited spatial extent of observations. We developed a method to model and map the montane forest ecotone using Landsat imagery to observe change at scales not possible for plot-based studies, covering mountain peaks over 39 000 km2. Our results show that ecotones shifted downward or stayed stable on most mountains between 1991 and 2010, but also shifted upward in some cases (13-15\% slopes). On average, upper ecotone boundaries moved down ‚àí1.5 m yr‚àí1 in the Green Mountains, VT, and ‚àí1.3 m yr‚àí1 in the White Mountains, NH. These changes agree with remeasured forest inventory data from Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH, and suggest that processes of boreal forest recovery from prior red spruce decline, or human land use and disturbance, may swamp out any signal of climate-mediated migration in this ecosystem. This approach represents a powerful framework for evaluating similar ecotonal dynamics in other mountainous regions of the globe.},

The characteristic tree taxa of the Big Woods were elm (Ulmus), basswood (Tilia americana), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), ironwood (Ostrya virginiana), bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis), butternut (Junglans cinerea), and ash (Fraxinus). The most common tree was elm, which comprised 27\% of the bearing trees. A buffer zone of fire‚Äîtolerant oaks and aspen generally lay between the Big Woods and prairie. The width of this zone depended on topography and on the presence of additional firebreaks, which in places formed sharp boundaries between the Big Woods and oak‚Äîaspen. The prairie‚Äîwoodland border was characteristically a sharp boundary along firebreaks (water bodies and physiographic breaks). In some places very effective firebreaks formed sharp boundaries between prairie and the Big Woods, with no intervening oak‚Äîaspen zone. The vegetation was most strongly correlated with the fire‚Äîprobability pattern, which was a function of both abiotic and biotic factors. Soils influenced the probability of fire, but they also were the major factor controlling the vegetation within areas of similar fire probability. Soil drainage was the most important factor controlling vegetation within the units of the overall pattern. Because the locations of firebreaks and the existing pattern of vegetation controlled the fire probability pattern, sites with virtually identical physical characteristics supported qualitatively different types of persistent or stable vegetation.},

	abstract = {Summary 1 Treeline ecotones, such as the prairie‚Äìforest boundary, represent climatically sensitive regions where the relative abundance of vegetation types is controlled by complex interactions between climate and local factors. Responses of vegetation and fire to climate change may be tightly linked as a result of strong feedbacks among fuel production, vegetation structure and fire frequency/severity, but the importance of these feedbacks for controlling the stability of this ecotone is unclear. 2 In this study, we examined the prairie‚Äìforest ecotone in south-central Minnesota using two lake sediment cores to reconstruct independent records of climate, vegetation and fire over the past 12 500 years. Using pollen, charcoal, sediment magnetic analyses and LOI properties, we investigated whether fires were controlled directly by climate or indirectly by fuel production. 3 Sediment magnetic and LOI data suggest four broad climatic periods occurring c . 11 350‚Äì8250 BP (cool/humid), c . 8250‚Äì4250 BP (warm/dry), c . 4250‚Äì2450 BP (warm/humid), and c . 2450‚Äì0 BP (cool/humid), indicating that, since the mid-Holocene, climate has shifted towards wetter conditions favouring greater in-lake production and fuel production on the landscape. 4 The area surrounding both lakes was characterized by boreal forest c . 12 500‚Äì10 000 BP, changing to an Ulmus-Ostrya forest c . 10 000‚Äì9000 BP, changing to a community dominated by prairie (Poaceae-Ambrosia-Artemisia ) and deciduous forest taxa c . 8000‚Äì4250 BP, and finally shifting to a Quercus -dominated woodland/savanna beginning c . 4250‚Äì3000 BP. 5 Charcoal influx increased from an average of 0.11‚Äì0.62 mm[sup 2] cm[sup -2] year[sup -1] during the early Holocene forest period (c . 11 350‚Äì8250 BP) to 1.71‚Äì3.36 mm[sup 2] cm[sup -2] year[sup -1] during the period of prairie expansion (c . 8250‚Äì4250 BP) and again increased to 4.18‚Äì4.90 mm[sup 2] cm[sup -2] year[sup -1] at the start of the woodland/savanna period (c . 4250 BP). 6 As a result of the influence of climate on community composition and fuel productivity, changes in fire severity may be the result and not the cause of shifts in vegetation.},

Our objectives were to determine ( i) if forests are encroaching into grasslands, ( ii) if rate and extent of encroachment varies by region or with topographic setting, and ( iii) if encroachment is related to climate change and variability. Dendroecological techniques were used to obtain dates of establishment for 1847 trees (trembling aspen ( Populus tremuloides Michx.) and white spruce ( Picea glauca (Moench) Voss)) sampled from 28 sites divided between two different regions and three topographic settings. Generalized linear modeling was used to identify relationships between climate and tree establishment. Results show that encroachment of forest, particularly aspen trees, into grasslands has been nearly ubiquitous on flat terrain and on south-facing slopes in both regions over the last 60-80 years. In contrast, spruce-dominated ecotones on north-facing slopes experienced little change. Aspen establishment was positively associated with spring temperatures and precipitation, although evidence suggests that other factors such as soil moisture interact with climate to mediate the timing and rate of tree encroachment. These results indicate that transformation of grasslands to aspen-dominated forest is an additional, but previously unexplored, element of the widespread ecosystem changes currently being experienced in northwestern North America.

	abstract = {Abstract: The prairie-forest transition in midcontinental North America is a major physiognomic boundary, and its shifts during the Holocene are a classic example of climate-driven ecotonal dynamics. Recent work suggests asymmetrical Holocene behavior, with a relatively rapid early Holocene deforestation and more gradual reforestation later in the Holocene. This paper presents a new synthesis of the Holocene history of the Great Plains prairie-forest ecotone in the north-central US and central Canada that updates prior mapping efforts and systematically assesses rates of change. Changes in percent woody cover (\%WC) are inferred from fossil pollen records, using the modern analog technique and surface-sediment pollen samples cross-referenced against remotely sensed observations. For contemporary pollen samples from the Great Plains, \%WC linearly correlates to percent arboreal pollen (\%AP), but regression parameters vary interregionally. At present, \%AP is consistently higher than \%WC, because of high background levels of arboreal pollen. Holocene maps of the eastern prairie-forest ecotone agree with prior maps, showing a rapid decrease in \%WC and eastward prairie advance between 10,000 and 8000¬†ka (1¬†ka=1000 calibrated years before present), a maximum eastward position of the ecotone from 7 to 6¬†ka, and increased \%WC and westward prairie retreat after 6¬†ka. Ecotone position is ambiguous in Iowa and southeastern Minnesota, due to a scarcity of modern analogs for early-Holocene samples with high Ulmus abundances and for samples from alluvial sediments. The northern prairie-forest ecotone was positioned in central Saskatchewan between 12 and 10¬†ka, stabilized from 10 to 6¬†ka despite decreases in \%WC at some sites, then moved south after 6¬†ka. In both east and north, ecotonal movements are consistent with a dry early Holocene and increasing moisture availability after 6¬†ka. Sites near the ecotone consistently show an asymmetric pattern of abrupt early Holocene deforestation ({\textless}300¬†years) and gradual reforestation after 6¬†ka. Early Holocene decreases in \%WC are faster than the corresponding drops in \%AP, because the analog-based \%WC reconstructions correct for the high background levels of arboreal pollen types that blur temporal variations in \%AP. For example, at Elk Lake, the \%AP decline lasts 1000¬†years, whereas the \%WC decline occurs between adjacent pollen samples, approximately 300¬†years apart. Thus, early Holocene deforestation may have been even more abrupt than previously recognized. Rapid deforestation likely was promoted both by rapid climate changes around 8.2¬†ka and positive fire-vegetation feedbacks. Non-linear vegetational responses to hydrological variability are consistent with 1) other paleorecords showing rapid die-offs of some eastern tree species in response to aridity and 2) observations of threshold-type ecological responses to recent climate events. The 21st-century trajectory for the Great Plains prairie-forest ecotone is uncertain, because climate models differ over the direction of regional precipitation trends, but future drying would be more likely to trigger threshold-type shifts in ecotone position.},

	abstract = {Questions Two alternative mechanisms of abrupt vegetation change across ecological boundaries have been proposed: (1) concomitantly abrupt gradients in physical environmental variables and vegetation across the boundary, and (2) gradual environmental gradients that vegetation responds to in a non-linear or threshold manner. Here, we evaluate spatial patterns of climate and vegetation across a grassland-forest biome boundary to examine evidence in favour of either of these alternatives. Location Minnesota, USA. Methods Vegetation data represented the presence of prairie vs. forest vegetation in Minnesota from 1847 to 1908, generally prior to European settlement of the region, while the climatic variables represented an index of long-term average moisture availability (precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration (P - PET). Using linear and sigmoidal regression models, we evaluated spatial patterns of change in vegetation, climate and vegetation-climate relationships across 22 transects (170-400 km) oriented perpendicular to the biome boundary. We also evaluated boundary characteristics in light of dominant topographical controls and position along the boundary. Results Vegetation followed a sigmoidal pattern of change across the boundary, with mean boundary width of ca. 100 km. The P - PET increased by ca. 100 mm across the boundary following a comparatively smooth pattern of change. Climate-vegetation relationships were clearly non-linear across the boundary, indicating these variables did not change in a common spatial pattern. Regional topographical controls modified relationships between vegetation and climate along the length of the boundary. Conclusions Our results document strong non-linear relationships between the presence of forest vegetation and its dominant climate control across a grassland-forest biome boundary. An average change of ca. 100 mm in P - PET moving across the boundary is about 40\% of the long-term mean annual range of this variable, suggesting that modest changes to P - PET may potentially cause substantial shifts in the location of the prairie-forest boundary.},

Œ¥18O is strongly correlated with the index of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) during the past 100 years, and periodicities of the late-Holocene Œ¥18O record are similar to those of the PDO. Furthermore, time series of Œ¥18O and atmospheric Œî14C are generally coherent after 700 AD.

In this study, we compare the transition into (ca. 9000‚Äì7000 yr ago) and out of (ca. 5000‚Äì2500¬†yr ago) the mid-Holocene (MH) period at Kimble Pond and Sharkey Lake, located along the prairie forest ecotone in south-central Minnesota, using high resolution (‚àº5‚Äì36yr) sampling of pollen, charcoal, sediment magnetic and loss-on-ignition properties. Changes in vegetation were asymmetrical with increasing aridity being marked by a pronounced shift from woodland/forest-dominated landscape to a more open mix of grassland and woodland/savanna. In contrast, at the end of the MH, grassland remained an important component of the landscape despite increasing effective moisture, and high charcoal influxes (median 2.7‚Äì4.0 vs. 0.6‚Äì1.7mm2 cm‚àí2 yr‚àí1 at start of MH) suggest the role of fire in limiting woodland expansion. Asymmetric vegetation responses, variation among and within proxies, and the near-absence of fire today suggest caution in using changes associated with mid-Holocene aridity at the prairie forest boundary as an analog for future responses to global warming.},

These ‚Äúmegadroughts‚Äù are identified at two spatial scales, the North American continental scale (exclusive of Alaska and boreal Canada) and at the sub-continental scale over western North America. Intense decadal droughts have had significant environmental and socioeconomic impacts, as is illustrated with historical information. Only one prolonged continent-wide megadrought during the past 500 years exceeded the decadal droughts witnessed during the instrumental period, but three megadroughts occurred over the western sector of North America from a.d. 1300 to 1900. The early 20th century pluvial appears to have been unmatched at either the continental or sub-continental scale during the past 500 to 700 years. The decadal droughts of the 20th century, and the reconstructed megadroughts during the six previous centuries, all covered large sectors of western North America and in some cases extended into the eastern United States. All of these persistent decadal droughts included shorter duration cells of regional drought (sub-decadal ‚âà 6 years), most of which resemble the regional patterns of drought identified with monthly and annual data during the 20th century. These well-known regional drought patterns are also characterized by unique monthly precipitation climatologies. Intense sub-decadal drought shifted among these drought regions during the modern and reconstructed multi-year droughts, which prolonged large-scale drought and resulted in the regimes of megadrought.},

	abstract = {1. Quercus macrocarpa (bur oak) is the dominant tree species along much of the prairie‚Äìforest border in the northern-central United States, and movement of Q. macrocarpa in response to climate change may determine the rate at which the prairie‚Äìforest ecotone shifts. To investigate likely controls over Q. macrocarpa performance at the edge of its range, we used tree rings to establish the links between drought, growth-rate and mortality for three sites spanning the prairie‚Äìforest border in Minnesota. 2. Quercus macrocarpa growth during the 20th century correlates strongly with the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and more weakly with raw temperature and precipitation values for all three sites. However, the sensitivity of annual growth rates to drought has steadily declined over time as evidenced by increasing growth residuals and higher growth rates for a given PDSI value after 1950 compared with the first half of the century. We hypothesize that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration may lead to increased water-use efficiency, although we cannot rule out other environmental factors. 3. Because growth is an excellent predictor of Q. macrocarpa mortality, growth‚Äìclimate relationships provide information on whether oak forests will contract, because of individual tree death, when climate changes. For Q. macrocarpa, declining sensitivity of growth to drought translates into lower predicted mortality rates at all sites. At one site, declining moisture sensitivity yields a 49\% lower predicted mortality from a severe drought (PDSI = ‚àí8, on par with the worst 1930s ‚ÄòAmerican Dust Bowl‚Äô droughts in our study region). 4. Unless the changing relationship between growth and climate is incorporated into forest simulation models, the predicted rate of established tree dieback in a warmer, drier climate may be exaggerated. 5. Synthesis. Adult Quercus macrocarpa trees appear to be increasingly insensitive to drought-induced mortality. Because the species is dominant at the prairie‚Äìforest ecotone in the northern-central United States, movement of the ecotone in response to climate change may be delayed for decades.},

	abstract = {The Maunder Minimum, also known as the "prolonged sunspot minimum", is the name used for the period starting in about 1645 and continuing to about 1715 when sunspots became exceedingly rare, as noted by solar observers of the time.
The term was introduced after John A. Eddy published a landmark 1976 paper in Science. Astronomers before Eddy had also named the period after the solar astronomers Annie Russell Maunder (1868‚Äì1947) and E. Walter Maunder (1851‚Äì1928), who studied how sunspot latitudes changed with time. The period which the husband and wife team examined included the second half of the 17th century.
Two papers were published in Edward Maunder's name in 1890 and 1894, and he cited earlier papers written by Gustav Sp√∂rer. Because Annie Maunder had not received a university degree (due to restrictions at the time), her contribution was not publicly recognized.
Sp√∂rer noted that, during a 28-year period (1672‚Äì1699) within the Maunder Minimum, observations revealed fewer than 50 sunspots. This contrasts with the typical 40,000‚Äì50,000 sunspots seen in modern times.
Like the Dalton Minimum and Sp√∂rer Minimum, the Maunder Minimum coincided with a period of lower-than-average European temperatures.},

	abstract = {. Seedling growth dynamics of Quercus macrocarpa Michx. and Quercus muhlenbergii Engelm. were compared over a 3-month period under optimal growth conditions. These two species are the dominant trees at the western limit of the eastern deciduous forest, and are typically confined to gallery forests along stream beds in tallgrass prairie. Since tallgrass prairie is characterized by a highly variable climate and is prone to periodic drought, we hypothesized that these oaks would have rapid root growth and produce deep taproots as seedlings, enabling them to avoid drought stress and persist in this region. These traits may also facilitate forest expansion into the more xeric tallgrass prairie if fires are suppressed. Taproots of Q. macrocarpa and Q. muhlenbergii grew to approximately 140 cm and 100 cm in length, respectively, after 104 days. In both species, 65\% or more of seedling biomass was allocated below ground, and root/total biomass was significantly greater in Q. muhlenbergii at 0‚Äì20 and 21‚Äì40 days after germination. The seedling taproot elongation rates reported here are much greater than rates reported in other eastern deciduous forest trees. Long-term precipitation data and soil moisture patterns from tallgrass prairie, when combined with rapid taproot elongation rates, suggest that soil moisture may not limit oak establishment or growth in tallgrass prairie in most years, although water uptake by roots was not measured in this study. Other factors, such as fire, herbivory, and seed predation and dispersal may be equally important in constraining the distribution of these species to gallery forests.},

	abstract = {1 Presettlement fire regimes in north-eastern North America and their dependence on climate, fuels, and cultural patterns are poorly understood due to lack of relevant historic or palaeoecological data. Annual records of sediment charcoal accumulation were compiled from seven sites spanning the last 2000 years and representing important climate, vegetation, and cultural settings. Results were compared across sites and across changes in Indian cultures to determine whether fire patterns might be explained by one or more of these variables. 2 Clearly interpretable fires were restricted to the western (most xeric) portion of our study region in Pine Hardwoods of Minnesota, a single fire in Northern Hardwoods of northern Wisconsin, and cultural burning near an Iroquois village in southern Ontario. Other sites in Northern Hardwoods and Hardwood-Hemlock forests did not show clear evidence of fire. Spectral analysis suggested instances in which local fire regimes departed from regional ones. 3 Our interpretation suggests substantially longer intervals between fires than reported in previous sediment charcoal studies. We did not find evidence for fire in mixed oak forests, where it has been speculated that fire might be necessary for oak recruitment, suggesting need for further analysis. 4 A single site in northern Wisconsin was the only Algonquin site showing a clear increase in charcoal suggesting local fire. Algonquin use of fire for hunting may not have affected our sites. A single site in Sioux territory experienced such frequent fire that cultural effects were not evident, even when Sioux were replaced by Chippewa (Algonquin) in the 18th century. One of two Iroquois sites showed clear increases in charcoal during occupation. The second site may not have had settlements nearby.},

In it, two basic issues are addressed--whether or not there is a civil religious dimension present in the inaugural addresses, and, if present, what are its characteristics. The findings were as follows: In all inaugural addresses the presence of a civil religious dimension was detected. Its content, as was suggested by Bellah (1970) and Cherry (1970), focuses around the themes of Exodus, Sacrifice, Destiny under God, and International Example. The prevalence of each was dependent upon the historical situation. A theoretical framework is built that suggests the presence and characteristics of civil religion perform three functions of culture building, culture affirmation, and, most importantly, legitimation.},

Attempts to predict the use of power language in inaugural addresses from variables representing the times (year, media, economic factors) and the man (presidential personality) lead to the conclusion that time-based factors are the best predictors of the use of such language (81\% prediction of variance in the criterion) while presidential personality adds at most a small amount of prediction to the model. Changes in power language are discussed as the outcome of a tendency to opt for breadth of communication over depth.},
